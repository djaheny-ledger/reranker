{"query": "ow long is the staking period for Ethereum (ETH) in order to start earning rewards in my Ledger Live account?", "relevant_passages": ["Staking ETH through Ledger Live with Lido: Lido's official FAQ might have the information you're looking for. What is Lido? Lido is a third-party staking service that lets Ethereum users stake their ETH and get stETH rewards* in return. The Lido app is not operated by Ledger but by the Lido team through Ledger Live. Since the Ethereum Merge, it's possible for anyone holding at least 32 ETH to run a validator node and help add blocks to the Ethereum blockchain in exchange for staking rewards. With Lido, you don't need 32 ETH to start staking. Lido will pool your ETH with funds provided by other users until the pool reaches 32 ETH. Lido will then set up a validator node by depositing the ETH into Ethereum's staking contract and proportionally share staking rewards with you in the form of stETH tokens. To make up for the loss of liquidity (your ETH being locked in the staking contract and unavailable to trade), Lido will send you a number of stETH tokens equivalent to the amount of ETH staked plus daily stETH rewards. You can learn more about how this works here. What is stETH? stETH is an ERC20 token whose value is indexed to the value of ETH. In other words, this means that the price of stETH should be roughly equivalent to the price of ETH. stETH is liquid. This means that it can be freely traded and transacted in and out of your Ledger wallet like any other ERC20 tokens. You can learn more about managing ERC20 tokens here. Finally, your Ledger stETH balance will increase daily to account for staking rewards. This update is automatic and does not require a transaction to your Ledger wallet. You can learn more about this automatic rebase mechanism here and you can use this tool to track your stETH rewards. How to stake ETH coins with Lido? Before you start Download and install the latest version of Ledger Live via this link. Install the latest version of the Ethereum (ETH) app on your Ledger device. Create an Ethereum account in Ledger Live. Install the Lido app on your Ledger device Open Ledger Live and navigate to My Ledger tab. Connect and unlock your Ledger device.

If asked, allow My Ledger on your Ledger device. Find Kiln in the app catalog. Click the Install button of the app. Staking your ETH coins in a Kiln pool Open Ledger Live and navigate to the Discover section to find the Kiln dashboard. In the dashboard, ensure that the correct Ethereum account is selected before you proceed to select 'Stake' under the 'Pooling' section. Select the amount of ETH to stake, the minimum is 0.05 ETH. After entering the desired ETH amount, check the box to accept the terms and conditions and click on 'Stake'. Ledger Live will now prompt you to sign the staking transaction with your Ledger device. Choose your desired fee option and click on 'Continue'. This is when you'll need your Ledger device. Continue by opening the Kiln app on your device, and then carefully review the transaction details that appear on your device screen. If everything checks out, you'll confirm the transaction directly on your Ledger device by navigating to the 'Accept and send' option and pressing both buttons to sign. Once the transaction has confirmed on the Ethereum network, your staked ETH balance will be visible in the Rewards tab of the Kiln dashboard under the Pooling section.At the same time, your Ethereum account will receive Pooled Staked (psETH) tokens equivalent to the amount of ETH you staked. These tokens represent your share in the pool. They will show in your Ethereum account in Ledger Live but, unlike other ERC20 tokens, they are tied to your Ethereum account and cannot be transferred. Unlike Lido stETH tokens, Kiln psETH tokens do not automatically rebase to reflect your staking rewards. Instead, your staking rewards will be displayed in the Rewards section of the Kiln dashboard and denominated in ETH. You're all set! Once the pool has 32 ETH to fund a validator and the validator has gone through the activation queue, you will start receiving ETH rewards which will appear in the Total rewards section of the Kiln dashboard. Tracking Ethereum (ETH) staking rewards earned via Ledger Live Kiln Ethereum (ETH) staking rewards will not appear in the earn tab of Ledger Live. To track your Ethereum ETH staking rewards earned by staking through Kiln, be sure to check the Total rewards section of the Kiln dashboard. Please note that it might take anywhere from a few hours to a few days before you start receiving ETH rewards, depending on the length of the activation queue which you can monitor at: https://www.validatorqueue.com/ How to unstake ETH staked in a Kiln staking pool Unstaking ETH from a pool is straightforward and can be initiated whenever you choose. It involves a couple of transactions with your Ledger device: request an exit and withdrawing your ETH. Navigate to the Withdraw section of the Kiln dashboard, click on Request exit and confirm the transaction on your Ledger device.Once the Ethereum network confirms your transaction, your balance set to exit will appear on the dashboard, and you'll get a Kiln Exit Queue NFT in your Ethereum account. This NFT is essential for the final step of the unstaking process, which is withdrawing your staked ETH and rewards back to your Ethereum account. This final step can be taken after a waiting period of 1 to 4 days, once your exiting ETH balance is marked as Withdrawable. At that point, you'll redeem your Kiln Exit Queue NFT by confirming a withdrawal transaction with your Ledger device, completing the process and receiving your initial staked ETH along with any rewards.You're all done!

Once claimed, rewards will be visible in the 'Latest Operations' section of your Polkadot account. To claim rewards yourself or track pending rewards, please use the third-party wallet Polkadot.js. Unstaking your DOT funds In Polkadot, unstaking a bonded DOT balance is a multi-step process. Each step requires a transaction which you need to confirm on your Ledger device. It takes 3 steps to completely unstake your DOT funds: Your bonded balance must first be chilled. In Ledger Live, chilling is called clearing nominations. Your chilled balance must then be unbonded. Unbonding takes 28 days to complete. Finally, your unbonded balance can be withdrawn back to your available balance. Once your DOT has returned to your available balance, it can be freely traded or transferred to third-party accounts. You can find a detailed breakdown of each step below.

What is Lido? Lido is a third-party staking service that lets Ethereum users stake their ETH and get stETH rewards* in return. The Lido app is not operated by Ledger but by the Lido team through Ledger Live. Since the Ethereum Merge, it's possible for anyone holding at least 32 ETH to run a validator node and help add blocks to the Ethereum blockchain in exchange for staking rewards. With Lido, you don't need 32 ETH to start staking. Lido will pool your ETH with funds provided by other users until the pool reaches 32 ETH. Lido will then set up a validator node by depositing the ETH into Ethereum's staking contract and proportionally share staking rewards with you in the form of stETH tokens. To make up for the loss of liquidity (your ETH being locked in the staking contract and unavailable to trade), Lido will send you a number of stETH tokens equivalent to the amount of ETH staked plus daily stETH rewards. You can learn more about how this works here. What is stETH? stETH is an ERC20 token whose value is indexed to the value of ETH. In other words, this means that the price of stETH should be roughly equivalent to the price of ETH. stETH is liquid. This means that it can be freely traded and transacted in and out of your Ledger wallet like any other ERC20 tokens. You can learn more about managing ERC20 tokens here. Finally, your Ledger stETH balance will increase daily to account for staking rewards. This update is automatic and does not require a transaction to your Ledger wallet.

Some USB cables (sometimes called charging cables) dont contain the pins necessary for data communication, and will successfully power your Ledger but wont allow communication. If you do not have the Ledger USB cable anymore, make sure the cable you use is capable of data transfer. If youre not sure, try another cable. Make sure that the USB cable is inserted fully into the Ledger device. On new devices, the USB-C port may be a little bit tight, so give it a bit of extra force and make sure youre plugging the USB cable in fully.

In such cases, you can restore your funds through your recovery phrase on any hardware or software wallet that supports 24-word recovery phrases. However, before proceeding, it's essential to understand the nuances and risks associated with this recovery method. Self-Service USB Connection Issues Before attempting recovery through your recovery phrase, make sure to rule out any USB connection issues. Ensure that your Ledger device is correctly connected to your computer and that you are using a reliable USB cable. Sometimes, issues can be caused by a bad cable or interference on your computer. You can troubleshoot and resolve USB connection issues by following the steps outlined in our guide: Fix USB connection issues with Ledger Live. Using Your Recovery Phrase with a Software Wallet You might be wondering, 'How is it possible that I can use my recovery phrase with a software wallet? Isn't this my Ledger Recovery phrase?' The answer lies in the fact that recovery phrases are essentially generic, following the BIP-39 standard. This standard ensures compatibility across various wallets, including hardware and software ones. In essence, your recovery phrase is like a key that can open different doors, not just the one on your Ledger device. The Risks of Restoring an Online Wallet with Your Recovery Phrase Restoring your wallet using your recovery phrase in an online environment poses certain risks. Your Ledger recovery phrase is highly secure because it remains offline, away from potential threats like malware and hacks. However, when you input your recovery phrase into an online wallet, you expose it to the digital world. This makes your recovery phrase vulnerable to potential security breaches. It's crucial to understand the risks involved and take necessary precautions when restoring your wallet online. Always ensure you are using a reputable and secure software wallet, and be cautious when entering your recovery phrase on any online platform. Changing your recovery phrase and creating new accounts If you find yourself in a situation where you need immediate access to your funds, it's essential to take steps to secure your assets. One option is to transfer your funds to a temporary, outside account, reset your device, and create a fresh wallet with a 24-word secret recovery phrase. Then, you'd send the funds back to your new accounts in Ledger Live. This can be done by following the steps outlined in our guide on how to change your recovery phrase and create new accounts. Restoring with an existing secret recovery phrase Looking to recover your accounts but facing issues with your current Ledger device? If you are, you can restore access by setting up a new Ledger Nano device using your original recovery phrase. This way, your recovery phrase remains secure while you regain control of your funds.

But for those who do want a back up of their Secret Recovery Phrase, Ledger Recover is the perfect solution. How Does Ledger Recover Work? For security, the fragmentation, encryption and decryption of your Secret Recovery Phrase happens on your Ledger device. Specifically, these functions occur within the Secure Element chip. To explain, inside each Ledger device, is a small computer chip called the Secure Element. This is one of the most secure computer chips in existence, also used in official passports and bank cards. So how does this process work? There are three integral steps in the Ledger Recover process: Encryption, Identity Verification and Decryption. Encryption When you subscribe to Ledger Recover, the secure element duplicates, encrypts and splits an encrypted version of the Secret Recovery Phrase, the entropy, into three fragments.

An EVM network refers to a blockchain that is compatible with Ethereum. EVM tokens such as ERC20 tokens, or BEP20 tokens are all EVM-compatible which means that they can be safely stored on any EVM network. I withdrew some EVM tokens from an exchange but they're not showing in Ledger Live It's very likely that you provided the correct address but selected the wrong network for your withdrawal. For example - sending ETH via the Binance Smart Chain network:A good rule of thumb is to always select the native network for the selected coins. For example: select the Ethereum network for ETH and ERC20 tokens, select the Solana network for SOL, Polygon for MATIC, etc. I withdrew my coins onto the wrong network, are they lost? No, as long as you provided an EVM address generated by Ledger Live and verified on your Ledger screen, your coins are not lost. How can I find my coins? Open your exchange account and head to the Withdraw(al) section. Find the withdrawal. Verify that the address provided is your Ledger address. Next, click on the TxID to open it in a block explorer. Check the name of the block explorer. For example: Etherscan: your coins have been withdrawn onto the Ethereum network.

Most common scenarios Forgot to include a Memo/Destination tag For some assets like XRP, Stellar, ATOM, HBAR, and others, exchanges require you to insert a memo/destination tag. A Memo or Destination Tag is an additional address property (numeric and/or string) that allows identifying the transfer recipient behind XRP/XLM/ATOM/HBAR address on a centralized exchange. Learn more. This Tag is provided by the exchanges and you need to insert it during the Send operation in Ledger Live.

Your only solution is to contact the exchanges support and assist them in identifying your deposit transfer. Wrong network of deposit Quite often, your transfer won't appear at the exchange if you selected the wrong network for the deposit of funds.

For example: If your ETH is on the Ethereum network, select Ethereum/ERC20 network for deposit and select this address for transfer.

It's important to remember that when sending XRP or XLM from your Ledger wallet to an exchange, including a memo tag is essential. Without it, the exchange may not credit your deposit. If you suspect that you've sent a transaction without a memo tag, the best course of action is to contact the exchange's support team directly for assistance in recovering your funds. Understanding the X-address Format Occasionally, exchanges may demand the use of an X-address for XRP transfers, a format distinct from the usual R-address used in Ledger Live. To ensure successful XRP withdrawals, you might need to convert your current R-address to this X-address format. In addition, some exchanges may ask for both an x-address and a memo. Even though it isn't obligatory to add a memo when moving funds to your Ledger wallet, you can fill in any sequence of characters or digits like '0000' or '1111' if it's requested. Important note for Coinbase users Coinbase has stopped supporting XRP transfers to X-addresses, and trying to do so will result in an 'Invalid address' error.

To solve this issue: For Desktop Users: Resolve this bug by updating your Ledger Live app to version 2.75.0 or higher. For Mobile Users: Resolve this bug by updating your Ledger Live mobile app to version 3.39.0 on your Android or iPhone device. Important note regarding Polkadot staking rewards The current minimum to earn staking rewards is 588 DOT coins. But to ensure consistent eligibility, it's best to bond more DOT coins than the minimum required. Typically 20 or more DOT above the minimum to earn staking rewards is enough to ensure consistent eligibility for rewards If you are below the minimum to get rewards staking from your account, consider joining a Polkadot Nomination Pool instead and get started staking with as little as 2.25 DOT. Earn Polkadot (DOT) rewards* by bonding assets first, and then nominating validators in Ledger Live. The validators you nominated will use your bonded assets to stake and collect rewards for you. Learn how nomination works.Learn more at: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018131260-Staking-Polkadot-DOT-through-Ledger-Live", "Staking Polkadot (DOT) through Ledger Live: Choose Reject to cancel the operation. You have successfully nominated validators.You can view the list of current nominations in the Nominations section on the Polkadot account page. Receiving DOT staking rewards It takes at least 2-3 days after a new nomination to begin receiving DOT staking rewards from validators. DOT rewards are received when an active validator you've nominated claims them for you. Typically, active validators do this daily. Once claimed, rewards will be visible in the 'Latest Operations' section of your Polkadot account. To claim rewards yourself or track pending rewards, please use the third-party wallet Polkadot.js. Unstaking your DOT funds In Polkadot, unstaking a bonded DOT balance is a multi-step process. Each step requires a transaction which you need to confirm on your Ledger device. It takes 3 steps to completely unstake your DOT funds: Your bonded balance must first be chilled. In Ledger Live, chilling is called clearing nominations. Your chilled balance must then be unbonded. Unbonding takes 28 days to complete. Finally, your unbonded balance can be withdrawn back to your available balance. Once your DOT has returned to your available balance, it can be freely traded or transferred to third-party accounts. You can find a detailed breakdown of each step below. Clearing nominations Clearing nominations (also known as chilling your nomination) is the first step towards unstaking your DOT funds . Your DOT will remain bonded but you will stop receiving staking rewards. Temporary issue with unstaking Polkadot (DOT) coins Some Polkadot users may encounter an issue where the option to clear nominations (a required step before unbonding DOT) is grayed out in Ledger Live, preventing them from unstaking their bonded DOT.

Basic information about countervalues in Ledger Live Countervalues in Ledger Live refer to the value of your cryptocurrency portfolio or individual coin/token expressed in traditional currencies such as USD or EUR. It's the monetary equivalent of your digital assets, often referred to as 'fiat value'. Temporary interruptions in pricing data can result in discrepancies in the countervalues displayed in Ledger Live. However, it's important to note that these interruptions don't affect the actual value of your assets. Missing Countervalues for Certain Tokens? For some crypto-assets like ERC20/TRC10/TRC20/BEP20 tokens, the countervalue in fiat currency may be missing: This can occur for several reasons: If the available rate providers do not have a trading pair with ETH/TRX/BNB, then the countervalue cannot be displayed. If the countervalue for a given pair is not reliable, it will not be displayed. This usually occurs when the trading volume is too low. If the countervalue is too low, it will be displayed as zero. How do I solve a countervalue issue? Check the health of our APIs Bugs, network updates or sudden peaks in user traffic might cause disruptions that prevent Ledger Live from returning accurate countervalues. You can monitor the health of our countervalue APIs on the Ledger Status page. API issues might cause temporary display issues like incorrect contervalues or extreme volatility of the values displayed in Ledger Live. Is the issue related to an ERC20 or BEP20 token? You can use the Zerion app in the Discover tab in Ledger Live to check the value of your tokens. In Ledger Live, navigate to the Discover tab and select the Zerion app. In the app, make sure to select the desired Account and Wallet then select the Overview tab.

This process will force Ledger Live to scan the blockchain and find all accounts associated with the SRP on your device. Learn more about how your accounts are tied to your SRP here. Also, ensure that your Ledger device still holds the private keys corresponding to the missing account in Ledger Live. If your Ledger was reset or used to create a new secret recovery phrase, you'll need to restore the private keys for the missing account using your recovery phrase, then re-add the account in Ledger Live with your Ledger device. Learn more about restoring your accounts with your recovery phrase here. If you've tried everything and the coins still aren't showing up, contact us, we'll be happy to help track them down.

Using this system allows the throughput of Bitcoin transactions to increase from around 7 per second to roughly 1 million per second. Polygon Polygon is a popular layer 2 blockchain built upon Ethereum. More specifically, Polygon is actually a sidechain of the Ethereum network. In short, it allows for faster and cheaper transactions than its parent blockchain. Polygon is popular with lots of DeFi projects and NFTs as it reduces the cost of deploying smart contracts significantly. Since the Ethereum gas fees can skyrocket when the network is busy, the polygon network offers users a good alternative for those wanting to execute small transactions quickly. Today, even big brands such as Starbucks use the polygon network for their web3 ventures. Why Are Layer 2 Blockchains So Important? Lower Cost and More Efficient for Users For users, these blockchains are dramatically faster and cheaper to use. Keeping the nuts and bolts of low-value transactions off-chain means users can trasfer assets quickly and with minimal network costs. Broader Blockchain Utility By facilitating transfers of value that are fast and efficient, layer 2 solutions open up broader possibilities for blockchain application. A great example of its possible impact includes El Salvador, where Bitcoin is legal tender. To illustrate, this would not have been possible without the speed and efficiency of the Lightning Network. Relieves the Mainnet Layer 2 solutions dont just benefit their users, but also the crypto ecosystem as a whole. With large segments of the network activity handled off-chain, congested mainnets are relieved of much of their traffic. This means a faster, more efficient system for transactions on the parent network. Plus, users pay lower transaction fees than they would on the parent chain too. Layer 2: Paving The Journey To Mass Adoption The limits of Layer 2 solutions are still being established, but the broad picture is clear. Layer 2 blockchains offer a practical way to manage smaller crypto value transactions, without compromising a parent chains underlying security. Simply, they use creative approaches to handling transaction data, which saves the user time and money. But Layer 2 blockchains are just one example of the web3 innovation taking place. With developers constantly seeking solutions to the big issue of scalability, broader application for blockchain technology seems inevitable. So make sure you understand the different blockchains so you can stay ahead of the curve. You may even save yourself some transaction fees in the process. Knowledge is power.

{"query": "20 days ago I withdrew my ethereum from the Lido stake on the ledger, but the ethereum has not yet been deposited into my ledger wallet. is there any other step I need to take?", "relevant_passages": ["Staking ETH through Ledger Live with Lido: Lido's official FAQ might have the information you're looking for. What is Lido? Lido is a third-party staking service that lets Ethereum users stake their ETH and get stETH rewards* in return. The Lido app is not operated by Ledger but by the Lido team through Ledger Live. Since the Ethereum Merge, it's possible for anyone holding at least 32 ETH to run a validator node and help add blocks to the Ethereum blockchain in exchange for staking rewards. With Lido, you don't need 32 ETH to start staking. Lido will pool your ETH with funds provided by other users until the pool reaches 32 ETH. Lido will then set up a validator node by depositing the ETH into Ethereum's staking contract and proportionally share staking rewards with you in the form of stETH tokens. To make up for the loss of liquidity (your ETH being locked in the staking contract and unavailable to trade), Lido will send you a number of stETH tokens equivalent to the amount of ETH staked plus daily stETH rewards. You can learn more about how this works here. What is stETH? stETH is an ERC20 token whose value is indexed to the value of ETH. In other words, this means that the price of stETH should be roughly equivalent to the price of ETH. stETH is liquid. This means that it can be freely traded and transacted in and out of your Ledger wallet like any other ERC20 tokens. You can learn more about managing ERC20 tokens here. Finally, your Ledger stETH balance will increase daily to account for staking rewards. This update is automatic and does not require a transaction to your Ledger wallet. You can learn more about this automatic rebase mechanism here and you can use this tool to track your stETH rewards. How to stake ETH coins with Lido? Before you start Download and install the latest version of Ledger Live via this link. Install the latest version of the Ethereum (ETH) app on your Ledger device. Create an Ethereum account in Ledger Live. Install the Lido app on your Ledger device Open Ledger Live and navigate to My Ledger tab. Connect and unlock your Ledger device.

Select preferred fees then click on Continue Sign the transaction on your Ledger device.Once the transaction is confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain you will receive an amount of stETH equivalent to the amount of ETH staked. How to monitor your ETH staking rewards with Lido? You can monitor your ETH staking rewards via Lido through Ledger Live. Simply head over to the Rewards section in the Lido dashboard. Staking rewards are distributed daily, leading to a direct increase in your stETH balance. How to unstake ETH coins with Lido? There are two options for unstaking/withdrawing stETH and converting it back to regular ETH in your Ethereum account: Option 1: Directly swap stETH for ETH using the Paraswap app, available in the Discover section of Ledger Live. This swap is quick, typically taking only as long as it takes for your transaction to confirm on the Ethereum blockchain. However, it's not recommended for very large amounts of stETH due to potential slippage. Option 2: Use the Lido dashboard in the Discover section of Ledger Live. The withdrawal process via the Lido dashboard typically takes between 1 to 5 days. For more in-depth technical details of the withdrawal process with Lido, you can explore the information here. Step-by-step instructions for unstaking your ETH through the Lido dashboard Open Ledger Live, navigate to the Discover section, and select the Lido dashboard. In the Lido dashboard, click on 'Withdrawals'. Choose the amount of stETH you wish to withdraw and click on 'Request withdrawal'. Follow the prompts in Ledger Live and on your Ledger device, confirming each action on your Ledger device. You'll need to sign a message with your Ledger device and then confirm a transaction to request the withdrawal of your staked ETH. After confirming your withdrawal request, your stETH balance will be removed from your Ethereum account and replaced with a Lido NFT. This NFT represents a claim on your staked ETH that's being unstaked (withdrawn). Learn how this NFT works in more detail here. Once your Lido NFT changes appearance, indicating that your ETH stake is ready for withdrawal, return to the Lido dashboard in Ledger Live. Navigate to Withdrawals > Claim to see your pending stETH ready to be claimed. Click 'Claim' and confirm the transaction on your Ledger device to finalize the withdrawal. After your 'Claim' transaction is confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain, the Lido NFT will be removed from your Ethereum account and replaced with your now-unstaked ETH. Learn more about the Lido NFT With Lido, your withdrawal request is represented by an NFT, minted upon signing the request transaction with your Ledger device. This NFT will be stored in your Ethereum (ETH) account and will change appearance when your ETH is ready to be claimed. There might be occasional delays in Ledger Live reflecting this change of appearance; if so, verify your NFT's status using Rainbow.me, located in the Discover section of Ledger Live. After claiming your ETH, the NFT will be burnt. Learn more about how Lido NFTs work here. Watch out for fake Lido NFTs You may receive unsolicited NFT airdrops that appear to be legitimate Lido or stETH NFTs, promising free money if redeemed on a third-party website.

If youve ever bought an NFT, exchanged crypto or simply sent funds from your wallet to another address, you may have experienced delays with your transaction. But have you ever considered where your transaction is during that delay? Seeing your funds in a pending state can be stressful. You might be thinking, Did it work? or Has my transaction failed? While the transaction is still pending, it goes to a specific place to await approval called a crypto mempool. But what is a mempool exactly, and how does it work? For a simple definition, the term mempool is a contraction of the words memory and pool. However, when it comes to the mempools role in blockchain technology , its a bit more complex than that. So lets dive in. What Is a Mempool? A mempool is a blockchain node s version of a waiting room for not-yet-approved transactions. Once you initiate it, your transaction automatically joins the queue in the mempool, before being processed on the blockchain. What Is a Mempool For? Mempools are an integral part of how a blockchain node functions.

Read on for an explanation of Segwit and Native SegWit in plain English . As Ledger users might have noticed, when adding a Bitcoin account in Ledger Live you are presented with two options: a Native SegWit account and a SegWit account. While one can easily tell the difference between a Native SegWit address (starting with bc1) and a SegWit address (starting with 3), wed like to take a closer look at what this exactly means. SegWit (P2SH) and Native SegWit (bech32) are not the first address formats to exist for Bitcoin accounts. The very first one was Legacy, where addresses would start with a 1. As Bitcoins price started to take off, the fees paid for each transaction started to look more pricey too. As a matter of fact, the transaction speed was on the slower side as well. Thus SegWit entered the field The SegWit ( Seg regated Wit ness) proposal was strongly contested at the time – in fact, the initial proposal known as SegWit2X was actually dropped and replaced with what we now know as SegWit. In August 2017, the soft fork implementing SegWit took place. Its adoption has quickly been taken up since and it started becoming the new standard. So what did SegWit change? SegWit – also referred to as Wrapped or Nested SegWit – reduced the size of each transactions data. It did this by separating certain data of the transaction signature from the transaction. By making transactions lighter in size, more transactions can fit into a single Bitcoin block. This in turn makes the Bitcoin network more scalable and its transactions faster. Even more, it immensely reduces the transaction fees for each Bitcoin transaction! SegWit also enabled second layer scaling solutions, leading to the birth of the Lightning Network. SegWit vs. Native SegWit Native SegWit – also known as bech32 – is the latest step in the address formats. It is even more weight-efficient than its predecessor. This means having an even faster transaction speed versus SegWit transactions, better scalability and even lower fees per transaction. To add to this, bech32 has better error-detection and makes addresses lowercase only for better readability. This is why its the most popular option… if present . The only downside of bech32 is that not every major platform supports this address format yet. While transactions between Legacy, SegWit and Native SegWit addresses are fully compatible, there are still quite a few exchanges and wallet providers that dont support sending BTC to a bc1 address yet. As such, when you add an account on Ledger Live you will be presented with both the possibility of adding a Native SegWit and/or a SegWit address.

What's the APY for staking with Ledger by Figment? APY (annual percentage yield) refers to the growth rate of your NEAR stake as rewards* are applied to it. The return for staking with Ledger is in line with the Near Protocol nominal yield minus a commission fee paid to Ledger and Figment for providing the staking service. Please note that staking rewards are not guaranteed as they depend on a number of factors including the networks performance and node uptime. You can learn more about Near Protocol staking here. Before you start Download and install the latest version of Ledger Live. Open Ledger Live, connect your Ledger device to My Ledger and make sure your Ledger device is running the latest firmware version (Nano S / Nano S Plus / Nano X). Make sure that the latest version of the Near Protocol (NEAR) app is installed on your Ledger device. How to delegate NEAR through Ledger Live? In Ledger Live, navigate to the Accounts section. Find your NEAR account. In the upper left corner, click Stake. You will see a pop-up window with some basic information about staking. Click Continue. A list of validators will appear. Select Ledger by Figment as the validator and click Continue. If you do not wish to delegate to Ledger, click Show all and select a different validator. Enter the amount you want to stake. Click Continue. Unlock your Ledger device and open the NEAR app. Review and approve the transaction with your device. You should see a message confirming that youve successfully delegated your NEAR assets. Ledger Live will display how much NEAR youve staked, how much youve got in rewards, and which validator pools you've staked with. About NEAR staking rewards Once staked, your NEAR rewards will be reflected in the rewards section of your NEAR account within Ledger Live. Your NEAR rewards are automatically added to your staked balance and do not need to be separately managed. If you decide to unstake your NEAR, you'll be unstaking the entire balance, which includes your NEAR rewards. Unstaking your NEAR When you choose to unstake, your NEAR rewards will be immediately cashed in and added to your available balance. However, your staked NEAR balance will become available for withdrawal within 52 to 65 hours. Go to your NEAR account. Scroll down until you see your staked balance and staking positions. Click Manage. Select Unstake. A pop-up window will show you which validator pools you're currently staking your NEAR with. Choose the validator you want to unstake your NEAR from. In our case, its Ledger by Figment. Enter the amount of NEAR you'd like to unstake from the validator. Click Continue. Review and approve the operation on your Ledger device. You will see a message confirming that youve successfully unstaked your NEAR assets. After unstaking a NEAR balance, it will shift to the Pending Release section of your NEAR account and remain there for 52 to 65 hours as it completes the unstaking process. Once this period has elapsed, you can sign one last transaction with your Ledger device to transfer the now-unstaked NEAR balance back to your available balance. Withdraw your inactive NEAR back to Available balance This final step allows you to fully unstake your NEAR and transfer it back to your available balance. Remember, you can only withdraw an unstaked NEAR balance after a period of 52 to 65 hours. Navigate to your NEAR account and scroll down until you see your staked balance and staking positions. Click Manage.Learn more at: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/7658561043613-Staking-NEAR-NEAR-through-Ledger-Live"]}
{"query": "how can you test to see if you set a secret passphrase on your ledger nano x", "relevant_passages": ["How to set up a passphrase?: Go to Security. Go to Passphrase and choose either of two options: Attach to PIN: Creates a second PIN code to unlock passphrase-protected accounts Set temporary: Enter the passphrase each time you wish to access passphrase-protected accounts Continue with the section below that matches the option you've chosen Option 1 - Attach to PIN code How it works Attaching a passphrase to a new PIN code creates a new set of secret accounts on your Ledger device based on a passphrase of your choice. You can access the accounts protected by this passphrase by entering a secondary PIN code. Only one passphrase can be attached to a PIN code. If you add another passphrase to the PIN code, you will overwrite the secondary PIN code and the passphrase. The private keys to your secret accounts will be stored in your ledger device until you overwrite your passphrase with another passphrase or until your device is reset. Store a physical backup of the secret passphrase in a secure place. The device cannot display it after you've set it. Instructions Choose Attach to PIN option from the Passphrase menu in the device security settings. Press both buttons to validate Set secret passphrase. Create a secondary PIN code. Re-enter the secondary PIN code to confirm it. Choose and confirm a secret passphrase (max 100 characters). Enter your primary PIN code to validate. Your device will continue managing the accounts based on your recovery phrase without passphrase. Please turn off the device and enter your secondary PIN code to access the passphrase-protected accounts. You can only create one secondary PIN code attached to a passphrase that provides access to a unique set of passphrase-protected accounts. Option 2 - Set temporary passphrase How it works Using a temporary passphrase provides access to a new set of accounts on your Ledger device for the duration of the session. Follow the instructions below each time you wish to access the accounts protected by the passphrase. The accounts are based on a secret passphrase of your choice. Store a physical backup of the secret passphrase in a secure place. The device cannot display it after initial setup. Instructions Choose Set temporary option from the Passphrase menu in the device security settings. Press both buttons to validate Set secret passphrase. Choose and confirm a secret passphrase (max 100 characters). Enter your primary PIN code to validate. Your device will now manage the accounts protected by this passphrase. To access your primary accounts, please restart the device and enter your PIN code as usual. Recover passphrase accounts This article describes how to recover your passphrase-protected accounts on a new or reset Ledger device. Change passphrase PIN This video describes how to change your passphrase PIN after your passphrase has been set. Passphrase security in practice Adding accounts to Ledger Live When you add an account, its extended public key (xpub) is stored in Ledger Live's user data folder, where it is encrypted by your password if you've set up password lock. To be sure that Ledger Live does not store information about passphrase-protected accounts, you may can simply remove these accounts after you've managing them in Ledger Live. Some users have requested the ability to automatically forget accounts. Plausible deniability To protect yourself in case of physical threat, make sure your primary PIN code unlocks only a minor part of your crypto assets. Then set up a passphrase attached to a PIN code and store more significant amount of crypto assets on the passphrase-protected accounts. If you are under duress to unlock your Ledger device, you can surrender your main PIN code to the attacker while hiding the PIN code that unlocks your passphrase-protected accounts. Recovery phrase protection Its a good security practice to keep multiple copies of your Recovery sheet and to store them in different geographic locations. To mitigate the risk of losing your crypto assets if one of the copies of your recovery phrase is compromised, you can set up a passphrase. If you do so, make sure to store paper backups of your passphrase, preferably in geographic locations that are different from the locations where you keep a backup of your recovery phrase. Silent Wiping of Passphrase PIN If you enter the wrong PIN three times, your extra PIN (passphrase PIN) might be erased without warning. This helps protect your extra PIN from unauthorized access, even if someone knows your regular PIN. It's important to know that entering the regular PIN correctly won't reset this extra PIN counter. This extra security keeps your device safe and makes sure your extra PIN and sensitive information are protected from unauthorized users. Learn more Learn how to optimize your account security.

Basic information about countervalues in Ledger Live Countervalues in Ledger Live refer to the value of your cryptocurrency portfolio or individual coin/token expressed in traditional currencies such as USD or EUR. It's the monetary equivalent of your digital assets, often referred to as 'fiat value.' Temporary interruptions in pricing data can result in discrepancies in the countervalues displayed in Ledger Live. However, it's important to note that these interruptions don't affect the actual value of your assets. Missing Countervalues for Certain Tokens? For some crypto-assets like ERC20/TRC10/TRC20/BEP20 tokens, the countervalue in fiat currency may be missing: This can occur for several reasons: If the available rate providers do not have a trading pair with ETH/TRX/BNB, then the countervalue cannot be displayed. If the countervalue for a given pair is not reliable, it will not be displayed. This usually occurs when the trading volume is too low. If the countervalue is too low, it will be displayed as zero. How do I solve a countervalue issue? Check the health of our APIs Bugs, network updates or sudden peaks in user traffic might cause disruptions that prevent Ledger Live from returning accurate countervalues. You can monitor the health of our countervalue APIs on the Ledger Status page. API issues might cause temporary display issues like incorrect contervalues or extreme volatility of the values displayed in Ledger Live. Is the issue related to an ERC20 or BEP20 token?

Community is the foundation of the expanding raft of NFT projects, and Discord is a fantastic resource for getting to know them – but do you know how to use it?  Imagine a place… Where you can belong  Do you feel like a Bored Ape, a Doodle or a Fluf? Maybe youre checking out a new DeFi protocol that sounds promising, or even itching to be part of our very own Ledger community (its pretty exclusive). Crypto might have started as digital currency for the tech savvy, but in 2022, community is whats driving the industry and its projects forward, as well as bringing newcomers into the ecosystem in droves. Yet unlike traditional businesses and groups, blockchain projects dont have a storefront or a head office – instead they use Discord as the main social interface to connect with their community. It is where you can ask questions, vibe with other people in the community and get key alpha on upcoming events. Discord is an indispensable tool for your crypto research – but is also a hotbed for scammers posing as well meaning community members. So here, we present the ultimate guide to Discord: its utility, its risks and how to stay safe as you get involved with new projects in the ecosystem. Why Is Discord So Important for Crypto? Discord is everywhere in crypto – more or less every project has its own server. And you might be wondering how it became so important to the industry. Crypto is a space where lightning fast innovation bursts from a decentralized ecosystem. A successful project could well be launched by developers who never met each other. Meanwhile, the success and legitimacy of that project rests on the engagement of its community, who are also scattered across the planet. With so much riding on staying connected, a fast, secure and effective communication platform was always going to be crucial to the space. This is where Discord comes in. Having started life as a social hub for gamers and developers, its unique proposition was to offer a tool for real-time, reliable, seamless communication. With the NFT and DeFi spaces being driven forward by many of the same gamers and developers who were already using Discord regularly elsewhere, it was quickly adopted by the crypto industry. This was the genesis of Discords OG status in the crypto scene. What Can You Learn From Discord? Would you buy a place in a new city without hanging out with the locals first? If the answer is no, then you already understand the premise of the platform. Whether youre into DeFi, NFT s or DAO s, joining a projects Discord can yield some valuable insights in relation to its development, legitimacy and future opportunities. Here, developers and creators will share information related to their roadmap, IRL events, new functionalities, partnerships or upcoming token drops, for example; all of this is valuable knowledge for anyone looking to know a bit more about a crypto project for themselves. Well discuss this below – for now, lets get to grips with the Discord interface so you can get started. How Do I Find a Project on Discord? Step 1) Download Discord Discord is an app, and can be downloaded to both desktop and phone. Before starting your research, the first step should always be to install the Discord interface, so youre ready to go. Step 2) Wait – It Says I Need an Invitation?! One of the specific features of Discord is that users require an invitation to join a community. This may sound complicated, but dont let it deter you. Youll find Discord links in a number of places, and these links are the invitations that will allow you to become a community member. On a Marketplace For NFT projects, one place to spot and dig deeper into a project is by heading to a well-established marketplace like OpenSea or Rarible. The beauty of doing this is that youll often be able to see if the project is verified by looking for a tick next to the project name – this means a real person from the marketplace has taken measures to confirm the project is legitimate, which offers a layer of credibility during those crucial first steps. On the Projects Website or Twitter If youre on the website or Twitter page of a project, first things first: make triple-sure its the official page. (Some scammers might duplicate a projects page with a tiny almost unnoticeable difference in the web link.) Once youre sure, look for a Discord – this will link you directly to their server. Through friends If youre hearing about a project through friends, you can then ask for an invitation link. Heres our very own Discord link, to show you an example: Discord.gg/Ledger You can either click this link to open the app and go to the server, or simply paste it into the add server tab in Discord. Both options will take you to the project youre interested in. Step 3) Navigating Discord for Newcomers Discord has its own lingo and structure, and knowing how to navigate the interface is key to you finding what you need. Servers On Discord, the community for each project exists on a server, which you can think of as a community chat room. These are spaces for groups to communicate and chat, and have their own rules set by the admins – each one is sort of like a little digital society. Servers can be made private – a feature you might want to use if you set up a chat group among friends, for example – but generally speaking, crypto and NFT community servers are free to join for anyone. Dont be deterred by the invitation system, this is normally just a link that anyone can click on. Once youre a member of a server, youll see it displayed in the bubbles at the far left edge of the page; this will allow you to navigate between all the different servers youre engaging with. Channels Within every server, there are channels – youll see these displayed underneath the name of the server youre currently in, with a # at the beginning. So what are channels for? Theyre designed to organize each server into different rooms where specific things can be discussed, be it developer chat, news or upcoming drops – you can see that in action in the image above. This enables you to filter out the noise and get to the hub of whatever you want to discuss. Now you know the basics of how it all works, the world is your oyster! Go ahead and ask questions, explore channels and keep an eye out for interesting announcements – you are now part of the community. Speaking of community, lets have a chat about that. When we hear the word community, its likely that security is one of the first things that comes to mind. And its understandable; the whole point of forming a community, both in the physician and digital realms, is to feel we are safe among like-minded people. But this can also leave you vulnerable. The best scams in any industry rely on social engineering – making you feel safe so you let your guard down. And when you think about it, Discord is a ready-made paradise for this type of activity – members arrive with high hopes and lowered suspicions, because here, youre already among friends. Right? Why Scammers Love Discord But first, a quick haiku: YOU DONT KNOW WHO YOURE TALKING TO ON DISCORD, FREN DO NOT FORGET THIS the fact is, anyone can pretend to be anything on Discord. There is no process of verification to be a community member, or even to prove a project is real.Learn more at: https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-to-stay-safe-on-discord"]}

Should you still have the previous recovery phrase, you can still regain access to your crypto assets. You could do this by either entering your recovery phrase on a Ledger hardware wallet (recommend for security reasons) or a software wallet (less secure).

It's impossible to regain access to that particular address without having the corresponding recovery phrase or a Ledger device that still has the correct recovery phrase stored on it. I copied an address from my transaction history and the funds sent to it are not appearing Copying an address directly from your transaction history rather than verifying it with your Ledger device introduces security risks. There are a few potential issues that could arise here, including: User-error: There is a chance that one might have accidentally copied a wrong address. For example, you may have accidentally copied an address you received funds from or sent funds to in the past.If that particular address is still one that you control, you can retrieve the funds. However, if that address does not belong to you the crypto assets may be lost. Address poisoning: Address poisoning is a type of scam where an attacker would either send a tiny or 0-value transaction to your address, or send a 0-value token transaction from your address.

This article discusses what to do if you've accidentally sent crypto to the wrong address. We can distinguish a few different scenarios for having sent crypto to the wrong address. You can read more about each situation - and if applicable solutions - below: I have sent crypto to an Ethereum-based address (starts with '0x') and haven't received it The most likely scenario is that you'd have sent your cryptocurrencies via a different network than the one you intended to receive it on. For example, if you want to send ETH to your Ethereum account, you'd need to use the Ethereum network. If instead you used the BNB smart chain network, the ETH would not show up under your Ethereum account. So long as the cryptocurrency was sent from an EVM-based blockchain to a different EVM-based network, you should be able to retrieve it. If the network is supported within Ledger Live, you'd simply need to add an account for that particular blockchain. In the example mentioned above, you'd have to add a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) account and the ETH would immediately be visible there. Do keep in mind that some blockchains (e.g. BSC, MATIC, Cronos) may use a different native currency and you'd need to have some to pay for transaction fees. You can read more about recovering assets sent to a wrong network here. If the crypto asset is sent to a network that is not EVM-based, there is unfortunately the chance that your crypto may be lost. Don't hesitate to contact us - we'd gladly see if there's any possibility of still recovering the assets, though do keep in mind that this is far from guaranteed. My Bitcoin (BTC) address changed and I sent it to the old address Bitcoin (BTC) is designed to consistently provide you with a new address.

Should you not know who the address belongs to, unfortunately the crypto assets would be considered lost. I sent crypto to a smart contract address, how can I get it back? Sending crypto funds to a contract address by mistake can be particularly challenging, as contract addresses often have specific functions and may not be designed to return mistakenly sent funds. If you've sent crypto to a contract address, the ability to recover those funds largely depends on the contract's design and the willingness of the contract owner to assist in the recovery process. Here are some steps you can consider:1- Contact the Contract Owner: If possible, reach out to the owner or team behind the contract. Explain the situation and ask if they can assist in returning the funds. Some contracts may have functions that allow the contract owner to return mistakenly sent funds, but this is not always the case.2- Consult with the Community: Sometimes, the community around the token or project associated with the contract address may offer advice or assistance based on previous similar incidents.Unfortunately, due to the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions, there's no guaranteed way to recover funds sent to a wrong address, especially when it comes to contract addresses.

Confirmation and processing of the received crypto by the swap provider Changelly. Confirmation and processing of the sent crypto by the swap provider Changelly. Confirmation of the Receive transaction on the blockchain network. Each of the above-mentioned steps may take a certain amount of time to get processed. Many factors can impact the delay, such as the network congestion on both networks of the swap, then the delay of the swap provider in processing the incoming and outgoing requests, and issues during KYC (Know-Your-Customer) verification. What should I do? We do recommend waiting until the swap is processed, it can take up to 3-4 hours. If it takes longer than that, please reach out to Changelly Support with your Swap ID.

There are many scenarios why this could be happening and this article can't cover all of them but it covers the most common scenarios. Most common scenarios Forgot to include a Memo/Destination tag For some assets like XRP, Stellar, ATOM, HBAR, and others, exchanges require you to insert a memo/destination tag. A Memo or Destination Tag is an additional address property (numeric and/or string) that allows identifying the transfer recipient behind XRP/XLM/ATOM/HBAR address on a centralized exchange. Learn more. This Tag is provided by the exchanges and you need to insert it during the Send operation in Ledger Live. If you already made a transaction without the Tag, your transaction would be still confirmed and the funds would reach the address of the exchange. However, they wont be able to identify and assign the transaction to your exchanges account. As transactions on the blockchain cant be canceled, Ledger wont be able to help you in this situation. Your only solution is to contact the exchanges support and assist them in identifying your deposit transfer. Wrong network of deposit Quite often, your transfer won't appear at the exchange if you selected the wrong network for the deposit of funds. This is a very crucial step since it is very easy to get confused when sending similar assets to the exchange. For example, for EVM assets like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and many others, the system uses the same address format for all the addresses. They all start with 0x... Thus, when sending Ethereum (ETH) to the exchange, Ledger Live won't detect the wrong address format if you send ETH to the Polygon Deposit address. The rule of thumb is to always select the network of the asset you transfer. For example: If your ETH is on the Ethereum network, select Ethereum/ERC20 network for deposit and select this address for transfer. If your ETH is on Optimism network, select Optimism network for deposit Any deviation from the correct network will result in you not seeing the assets at the exchange and you needing to contact the exchange so they can recover your assets.

Bitcoin transaction is pending If you just sent the transaction and it shows as not confirmed and pending, then it is normal. It takes some time for the transactions to get confirmed on the blockchain and depending on the fees you selected, it may take from 1 minute to several hours. Network congestion also has a big impact on how long you need to wait. If many people are doing transactions right now, it will increase the waiting time. What should I do if my Bitcoin transaction has been pending for a long time? Initial Steps: If you've recently initiated the Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, patience is key. Wait for approximately 2-3 hours. During this time, clear the cache in Ledger Live often and then recheck the transaction status. Assessing the Transaction: If your transaction remains unconfirmed after more than 3 hours, it's likely that the network fees (sat per byte) set during the sending process were too low. To understand more about Bitcoin network fees and their impact, consider exploring educational resources on this topic. Speeding Up the Transaction: You have the option to accelerate the transaction process using your Ledger device connected with the Electrum wallet. This method can be particularly effective in expediting pending Bitcoin transactions. Preventive Measures for Future Transactions: In scenarios of heightened congestion or price volatility on the Bitcoin network, its recommended to set custom fees for your transactions.

Try another cable or USB port Ideally, use the USB cable that came in the box (there should be the Ledger logo on it). Some USB cables (sometimes called charging cables) dont contain the pins necessary for data communication, and will successfully power your Ledger but wont allow communication. If you do not have the Ledger USB cable anymore, make sure the cable you use is capable of data transfer. If youre not sure, try another cable. Make sure that the USB cable is inserted fully into the Ledger device. On new devices, the USB-C port may be a little bit tight, so give it a bit of extra force and make sure youre plugging the USB cable in fully. If youre sure youre using a data cable that is inserted fully, and the issue still persists, go to the next solution.

Should you not know who the address belongs to, unfortunately the crypto assets would be considered lost. I sent crypto to a smart contract address, how can I get it back? Sending crypto funds to a contract address by mistake can be particularly challenging, as contract addresses often have specific functions and may not be designed to return mistakenly sent funds. If you've sent crypto to a contract address, the ability to recover those funds largely depends on the contract's design and the willingness of the contract owner to assist in the recovery process. Here are some steps you can consider:1- Contact the Contract Owner: If possible, reach out to the owner or team behind the contract. Explain the situation and ask if they can assist in returning the funds. Some contracts may have functions that allow the contract owner to return mistakenly sent funds, but this is not always the case.2- Consult with the Community: Sometimes, the community around the token or project associated with the contract address may offer advice or assistance based on previous similar incidents.Unfortunately, due to the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions, there's no guaranteed way to recover funds sent to a wrong address, especially when it comes to contract addresses.

{"query": "I am facing an issue with a transaction where I sent 1000 XLM to Kraken but forgot to include the memo code. Can you provide guidance on how to retrieve the transaction details and possibly recover the funds sent without the memo code?", "relevant_passages": ["My funds did not arrive at the exchange:  My funds did not arrive at the exchange This article explains why your transfer of crypto from your Ledger account in Ledger Live may not reach the exchange. There are many scenarios why this could be happening and this article can't cover all of them but it covers the most common scenarios. Most common scenarios Forgot to include a Memo/Destination tag For some assets like XRP, Stellar, ATOM, HBAR, and others, exchanges require you to insert a memo/destination tag. A Memo or Destination Tag is an additional address property (numeric and/or string) that allows identifying the transfer recipient behind XRP/XLM/ATOM/HBAR address on a centralized exchange. Learn more. This Tag is provided by the exchanges and you need to insert it during the Send operation in Ledger Live. If you already made a transaction without the Tag, your transaction would be still confirmed and the funds would reach the address of the exchange. However, they wont be able to identify and assign the transaction to your exchanges account. As transactions on the blockchain cant be canceled, Ledger wont be able to help you in this situation. Your only solution is to contact the exchanges support and assist them in identifying your deposit transfer. Wrong network of deposit Quite often, your transfer won't appear at the exchange if you selected the wrong network for the deposit of funds. This is a very crucial step since it is very easy to get confused when sending similar assets to the exchange. For example, for EVM assets like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and many others, the system uses the same address format for all the addresses. They all start with 0x... Thus, when sending Ethereum (ETH) to the exchange, Ledger Live won't detect the wrong address format if you send ETH to the Polygon Deposit address. The rule of thumb is to always select the network of the asset you transfer. For example: If your ETH is on the Ethereum network, select Ethereum/ERC20 network for deposit and select this address for transfer. If your ETH is on Optimism network, select Optimism network for deposit Any deviation from the correct network will result in you not seeing the assets at the exchange and you needing to contact the exchange so they can recover your assets.

Basic information about countervalues in Ledger Live Countervalues in Ledger Live refer to the value of your cryptocurrency portfolio or individual coin/token expressed in traditional currencies such as USD or EUR. It's the monetary equivalent of your digital assets, often referred to as 'fiat value.' Temporary interruptions in pricing data can result in discrepancies in the countervalues displayed in Ledger Live. However, it's important to note that these interruptions don't affect the actual value of your assets. Missing Countervalues for Certain Tokens? For some crypto-assets like ERC20/TRC10/TRC20/BEP20 tokens, the countervalue in fiat currency may be missing: This can occur for several reasons: If the available rate providers do not have a trading pair with ETH/TRX/BNB, then the countervalue cannot be displayed. If the countervalue for a given pair is not reliable, it will not be displayed. This usually occurs when the trading volume is too low. If the countervalue is too low, it will be displayed as zero. How do I solve a countervalue issue? Check the health of our APIs Bugs, network updates or sudden peaks in user traffic might cause disruptions that prevent Ledger Live from returning accurate countervalues. You can monitor the health of our countervalue APIs on the Ledger Status page. API issues might cause temporary display issues like incorrect contervalues or extreme volatility of the values displayed in Ledger Live. Is the issue related to an ERC20 or BEP20 token? You can use the Zerion app in the Discover tab in Ledger Live to check the value of your tokens. In Ledger Live, navigate to the Discover tab and select the Zerion app. In the app, make sure to select the desired Account and Wallet then select the Overview tab.

Go to Passphrase and choose either of two options: Attach to PIN: Creates a second PIN code to unlock passphrase-protected accounts Set temporary: Enter the passphrase each time you wish to access passphrase-protected accounts Continue with the section below that matches the option you've chosen Option 1 - Attach to PIN code How it works Attaching a passphrase to a new PIN code creates a new set of secret accounts on your Ledger device based on a passphrase of your choice. You can access the accounts protected by this passphrase by entering a secondary PIN code. Only one passphrase can be attached to a PIN code. If you add another passphrase to the PIN code, you will overwrite the secondary PIN code and the passphrase. The private keys to your secret accounts will be stored in your ledger device until you overwrite your passphrase with another passphrase or until your device is reset. Store a physical backup of the secret passphrase in a secure place. The device cannot display it after you've set it. Instructions Choose Attach to PIN option from the Passphrase menu in the device security settings. Press both buttons to validate Set secret passphrase. Create a secondary PIN code. Re-enter the secondary PIN code to confirm it. Choose and confirm a secret passphrase (max 100 characters). Enter your primary PIN code to validate. Your device will continue managing the accounts based on your recovery phrase without passphrase. Please turn off the device and enter your secondary PIN code to access the passphrase-protected accounts.

Recover passphrase accounts This article describes how to recover your passphrase-protected accounts on a new or reset Ledger device. Change passphrase PIN This video describes how to change your passphrase PIN after your passphrase has been set. Passphrase security in practice Adding accounts to Ledger Live When you add an account, its extended public key (xpub) is stored in Ledger Live's user data folder, where it is encrypted by your password if you've set up password lock. To be sure that Ledger Live does not store information about passphrase-protected accounts, you may can simply remove these accounts after you've managing them in Ledger Live. Some users have requested the ability to automatically forget accounts. Plausible deniability To protect yourself in case of physical threat, make sure your primary PIN code unlocks only a minor part of your crypto assets. Then set up a passphrase attached to a PIN code and store more significant amount of crypto assets on the passphrase-protected accounts. If you are under duress to unlock your Ledger device, you can surrender your main PIN code to the attacker while hiding the PIN code that unlocks your passphrase-protected accounts. Recovery phrase protection Its a good security practice to keep multiple copies of your Recovery sheet and to store them in different geographic locations. To mitigate the risk of losing your crypto assets if one of the copies of your recovery phrase is compromised, you can set up a passphrase. If you do so, make sure to store paper backups of your passphrase, preferably in geographic locations that are different from the locations where you keep a backup of your recovery phrase. Silent Wiping of Passphrase PIN If you enter the wrong PIN three times, your extra PIN (passphrase PIN) might be erased without warning. This helps protect your extra PIN from unauthorized access, even if someone knows your regular PIN. It's important to know that entering the regular PIN correctly won't reset this extra PIN counter. This extra security keeps your device safe and makes sure your extra PIN and sensitive information are protected from unauthorized users. Learn more Learn how to optimize your account security.

Carefully read this article and watch the video before setting up a passphrase. Security tip The recovery phrase and passphrase functionalities enable a wide range of security setups. You may use them to design the security strategy that meets your personal situation. Please do not overcomplicate things, the best security setup is one that you master and can execute with confidence. How the passphrase works The passphrase is distinct from your 24-word recovery phrase and is essentially an optional password added to your recovery phrase that provides access to a whole new set of secret accounts. The passphrase protects your crypto assets if your 24-word recovery phrase were to be compromised. To access passphrase-protected accounts, an attacker will need your recovery phrase as well as your passphrase. Each different passphrase unlocks a unique set of secret accounts. You can use as many passphrases as you like. Your passphrase is never saved on your device. Instead, it's only used to derive a secondary seed that safeguards a distinct set of 'secret accounts'. If you decide to attach your passphrase to a PIN, the secondary seed and secret accounts' private keys will be secured within your device's secure element. However, after the passphrase is used to generate the second seed, it's discarded and never stored. If you choose a temporary passphrase, all related data, including the passphrase, secret accounts, and private keys, is deleted after each session. This means you'll need to input the passphrase again every time you wish to access the hidden accounts. Once your passphrase is set up, it cannot be verified on the device, underscoring the importance of having a reliable backup in place. Similarly, the Recovery Check app cannot be used to verify your passphrase. Does Ledger Recover have access to my passphrase? Ledger Recover is an optional subscription-only service for backing up your seed. If used, Ledger Recover never has access to your passphrase and secret accounts — whether you're using a temporary passphrase or one attached to a PIN.

As such, the recovery phrase should be something that is long and nearly impossible for anyone to guess. Your recovery phrase isnt like a password or a PIN (Ledger devices already have PINs to protect access to them), instead, its the root of all of your cryptographic secrets. Once your device randomly generates it for the first time and you write it down on paper, you will only need to access it if you have to recover your device. Ledger uses a standard called BIP 39 for the generation and interpretation of the recovery phrase on all of our devices. BIP 39 is an industry-standard used by many other hierarchical deterministic wallets. The exact type of BIP 39 seed used by Ledger devices by default is a 24-word mnemonic that consists of only the 2048 words from the BIP 39 English wordlist. Heres how a BIP 39 24-word mnemonic seed is generated: The device generates a sequence of 256 random bits using the True Random Number Generator (TRNG) built into the devices Secure Element. The first 8 bits of the SHA-256 hash of the initial 256 bits are appended to the end, giving us 264 bits All 264 bits are split into 24 groups of 11 bits Each group of 11 bits is interpreted as a number in the range 0 - 2047, which serves as an index to the BIP 39 wordlist, giving us 24 words. It's important to note that although a Ledger device can be restored using a recovery phrase of 12, 18, or 24 words, Ledger devices only generate 24-word recovery phrases. They do not create phrases of 12 or 18 words. The result of this process is that your device will generate a single mnemonic seed out of 2256 possible mnemonic seeds (Thats one of 115 792 089 237 316 195 423 570 985 008 687 907 853 269 984 665 640 564 039 457 584 007 913 129 639 936 possible mnemonic seeds). Note that while the first 23 words are completely random, the final word is derived from 3 random bits and 8 calculated bits from the SHA-256 hash.Learn more at: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415198323089-How-Ledger-device-generates-24-word-recovery-phrase"]}

By Kirsty Moreland Oct 23, 2021 | Updated May 10, 2023 Read 5 min Beginner SHARE KEY TAKEAWAYS: — Your cryptocurrency is stored on the blockchain and your private key unlocks the use of the crypto coins/tokens. — If Ledger didnt exist anymore, your cryptocurrency coins and keys would be safe and you could still access them. — You can retrieve your private key that your Ledger wallet was securing with a 24-word recovery phrase and it can be entered into a compatible wallet, meaning your coins are safe from loss if anything happened to Ledger. The Ledger wallet is a fantastic way to store the private keys to my crypto, but what would happen to them if Ledger went out of business? Would I lose them? While this exact phrasing might not have flashed across your mind, the question and the underlying concern might have.Learn more at: https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-if-ledger-goes-out-of-business", "what if ledger goes out of business: The short answer: No, not at all. Your coins would still be safe and you can still access them even if Ledger doesnt exist. The longer answer requires a little insight into where your coins live and how theyre stored and secured. Where Do My Coins Live? When you own cryptocurrency, you actually own the right to use the cryptocurrency. Your coins are associated with a set of keys: your private and your public key. You can think of your public key like a mailbox. If John wants to send you crypto, he just needs your public address. Its safe for you to give out your public key. Your private key is what you need to unlock the mailbox. The private key = access to your cryptocurrency. Like a real key, you wouldnt go handing out copies to everyone, youd keep it safe and secure to protect the assets that are secured by the lock. Similarly, you want to keep your private key safe. The crypto coins live on the blockchain and the keys to your coins live where you choose (ideally, in a secure location where no one else can access). The coins themselves dont exist on any device or platform, not even on Ledger devices . Your wallet only stores and protects your private key. Quick recap: your coins live on the blockchain, your keys live in your wallet. And if your private key isnt kept private, nor are your coins. Remember: Not your keys, not your coins . How Do I Keep My Cryptocurrency And Private Key Safe? One way people protect their private keys is by keeping it off the internet. This means there is no history of information that could be hijacked or hacked. Getting your coins stolen by a hacker might seem like something from Mr Robot, but youd be surprised how common it is if theres not enough security in place. Tweeting about your crypto, for example, is enough to let someone know that you hold crypto and if you dont have protection in place, youre vulnerable to a hack attack. A hardware wallet, which secures your keys in an offline environment, is the most secure option to store private keys – and Ledger offers one of the most comprehensive wallets that allows you to store and safekeep your private keys. How Does Ledger Keep Your Keys Safe? Ledgers features are designed to protect your keys with key elements, boasting security. As the only certified hardware wallet on the market, the Secure Elements chip is designed to withstand advanced cyber attacks. The real kicker about Ledger devices (and where the maximum security comes from) is that your private keys never leave the device. Ledger doesnt know them so theyre not held in a data bank anywhere. What you get is a 24-word long recovery phrase that is generated by the device in the set-up phase. This phrase is the single most important thing to protect, because it will allow you to restore your keys if anything happens. Like your private key, you want to keep this phrase in an offline environment and make sure it stays safe and sound somewhere where it wont get lost. If you lose your device and are worried about someone getting into your coins, you dont need to stress. If the person doesnt know your pincode (which you choose, in the same as with your mobile), youre safe. You also dont need to worry about the loss of your coins, you can still access them by restoring your private key using your recovery phrase on any other wallet. So the link between Ledger and your cryptocurrency is not that Ledger owns or has access to your keys, rather Ledger wallets store and keep your private keys safe so that you can look after your own funds. Do I Need Ledger To Get To My Cryptocurrency? So Ledger is great and it helps me keep my keys safe, but what if it goes out of business? Will I lose my crypto coins?! Another short answer: Nope, you arent reliant on Ledger to access your funds even if you use Ledger to store your private key. The slightly longer answer: Ledger doesnt operate in a closed system where your private keys and coins are locked into only certain devices, and this is thanks to something known as the BIP-39 standard . BIP39 is an industry wide protocol that sees crypto wallet providers use a common emergency back up format. It allows the contents of your wallet to be recovered via any other wallet using a mnemonic recovery phrase in the case of loss or theft, and means your assets are not tied to any one wallet provider. This is the 24-word recovery phrase you read about earlier. By operating within an open system, Ledger prioritizes the protection of your funds over profit, meaning you can benefit from the highest level of security while maintaining complete financial freedom. This means that you are able to access the keys to your cryptocurrency even if your Ledger wallet wanders out of your possession (by loss or theft). Your recovery phrase will let you retrieve your keys on another wallet even if Ledger isnt around anymore. Remember: Your cryptocurrency is stored on the blockchain and your address has a private and public key associated with it. You own the key to unlock the use of the cryptocurrency and Ledger helps you keep that key secure and protected. Ledger wallets have a recovery phrase to safeguard your keys – and your crypto – against loss. If Ledger did go out of business, neither your cryptocurrency nor your private and public keys would disappear. True Security Doesnt Tie You Down The features and components of Ledgers hardware wallets offer you unparalleled security; the Nano uses the most secure chip in the industry to secure your private keys and is protected by a pin code controlled by you alone. Yet, thanks to the BIP39 protocol, any assets that are secured using a Ledger hardware wallet can also be recovered via any other wallet in case of emergency, or if Ledger goes out of business. So using a Ledger device does not mean that Ledger has access to your crypto or any of your data; rather, its a meticulously designed solution that allows you to easily, securely and practically manage your crypto, without submitting any of your control – that is financial freedom.

Basic information about countervalues in Ledger Live Countervalues in Ledger Live refer to the value of your cryptocurrency portfolio or individual coin/token expressed in traditional currencies such as USD or EUR. It's the monetary equivalent of your digital assets, often referred to as 'fiat value.' Temporary interruptions in pricing data can result in discrepancies in the countervalues displayed in Ledger Live. However, it's important to note that these interruptions don't affect the actual value of your assets. Missing Countervalues for Certain Tokens? For some crypto-assets like ERC20/TRC10/TRC20/BEP20 tokens, the countervalue in fiat currency may be missing: This can occur for several reasons: If the available rate providers do not have a trading pair with ETH/TRX/BNB, then the countervalue cannot be displayed. If the countervalue for a given pair is not reliable, it will not be displayed. This usually occurs when the trading volume is too low. If the countervalue is too low, it will be displayed as zero. How do I solve a countervalue issue? Check the health of our APIs Bugs, network updates or sudden peaks in user traffic might cause disruptions that prevent Ledger Live from returning accurate countervalues. You can monitor the health of our countervalue APIs on the Ledger Status page. API issues might cause temporary display issues like incorrect contervalues or extreme volatility of the values displayed in Ledger Live. Is the issue related to an ERC20 or BEP20 token? You can use the Zerion app in the Discover tab in Ledger Live to check the value of your tokens. In Ledger Live, navigate to the Discover tab and select the Zerion app. In the app, make sure to select the desired Account and Wallet then select the Overview tab. In the tab, scroll down to the Assets section.Your ERC20 and BEP20 tokens balance and value are displayed here. Clear cache Clear cache to force Ledger Live to resynchronize your Ledger accounts. In Ledger Live, click on Settings. Click the Help tab. Click the Clear button to clear cache. Click Confirm after reading the instructions.

{"query": "If I redelegate my ADA coins from one validator to another through Ledger, will I have to wait for another 15 to 20 days to start receiving staking rewards from the new validator or stake pool operator (SPO)?", "relevant_passages": ["How to stake Cardano (ADA) through Ledger Live and get rewards:  How to stake Cardano (ADA) through Ledger Live and get rewards This article explains how to delegate (stake) ADA through Ledger Live and get rewards*. Learn more ℹ️ An initial deposit of 2 ADA is required to activate a delegation. When you deactivate your delegation, the network will refund you. Whats the Staking Rewards Rate (SRR) for staking with Ledger by Figment? Staking Rewards Rate (SRR) refers to the rate of growth on your ADA staking rewards. This rate depends on different factors including the Cardano networks performance and node uptime. Staking rewards are added to your ADA rewards balance at the end of every epoch (about every five days) for the previous epoch and show instantly in the Rewards section of your Cardano (ADA) account. For first-time ADA stakers, however, it can take up to 5 epochs to get your rewards, this mean that your first ADA staking rewards will arrive between 20 to 25 days, depending on when you initiated the delegation in the current epoch. The return for staking with Ledger by Figment is in line with the Cardano network nominal rewards minus a commission fee paid to Ledger by Figment. Before you start You should have the latest version of Ledger Live installed. Ensure that your Ledger Nano S / Nano S Plus / Nano X is running the latest OS version. Ensure that you have Cardano (ADA) app installed on your Ledger device. Video instructions Delegate (stake) a Cardano (ADA) balance Connect your Ledger device to your computer. In the Ledger Live app, navigate to Accounts and select your Cardano (ADA) account. In your account, click Stake. Select Ledger by Figment as a validator and click Continue. You can also select a different validator. Why is Ledger Live saying it costs 340/345 ADA to delegate? The 'Cost 340 ADA' you're seeing in Ledger Live when selecting a stake pool is actually the minimum fixed cost per epoch (5 days) that the stake pool operator can set. This cost is not charged to you but is deducted from the total rewards of the pool before they are distributed to stakers. The remaining rewards are then distributed proportionally to the stake of each staker, after the pool's variable fee (the n% commission) is also deducted. So, as an individual staker, you're not directly paying this 340 ADA cost. Review the transaction details and click Continue. At this time, you cannot select a specific amount of ADA coins to delegate; you must delegate your entire ADA balance. Unlock your Ledger device and then open the Cardano ADA app on your device. On your Ledger device, review the staking transaction. If all looks good, navigate to the screen that displays the words Confirm transaction then press both buttons simultaneously to sign and broadcast the transaction to end your Cardano (ADA) delegation. Just as with sending transactions, reviewing your staking transaction on your device involves navigating through multiple screens. To move from one screen to another, press the corresponding buttons. Youll see a message stating that youve successfully delegated your assets. Click Close. Once your transaction has been confirmed on the Cardano blockchain, your delegated ADA balance will appear in the Delegation section in your Cardano account. You're all set!Note About Cardano Rewards: Your Cardano (ADA) rewards are automatically added back to your staked balance upon receipt. Additionally, you may notice that the address associated with your delegation in Ledger Live's transaction history differs from your Cardano receiving address. This is normal. Each delegation and transaction to your Cardano account locks your ADA coins into a unique address, all of which are under your control End your Cardano (ADA) delegation (unstake) In Ledger Live, navigate to Accounts and select your Cardano (ADA) account. Go to the Delegation section and find your delegated balance.Learn more at: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/7880073204253-How-to-stake-Cardano-ADA-through-Ledger-Live-and-get-rewards"], "hard_negatives": [""]}

Can you provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?", "relevant_passages": ["Staking Solana (SOL) through Ledger Live: Click here to learn more. What's the APY for staking with Ledger by Figment? APY (annual percentage yield) refers to the rate of growth on your SOL stake as staking rewards* accrue to it. Staking rewards will directly accrue to your delegated SOL balance every 2/3 days. The return for staking with Ledger is in line with the Solana network nominal yield (which you can look up here) minus a commission fee. Please note that staking returns depends on a number of factors including Solana's network performance and node uptime. You can learn more about Solana staking here. Before you start Download and install the latest version of Ledger Live on to your computer or mobile. Open Ledger Live, connect your Ledger device to the 'My Ledger' section in Ledger Live and make sure your Ledger device is running the latest firmware version (Nano S / Nano S Plus / Nano X). Make sure that the latest version of the Solana (SOL) app is installed on your Ledger device. You need version 1.2.0 or above to stake. Video instructions Delegating SOL in Ledger Live What am I delegating exactly? Do I still own my SOL coins? Delegation can be a confusing term, as it refers to transferring your voting rights rather than your private keys. Validators in Solana place a high value on these voting rights because the more votes delegated to a validator, the greater their chance of becoming the leader who can add new blocks to the Solana blockchain. Although there are multiple validators, only one can be the leader at any given time, and leadership is constantly rotating. By delegating your vote to a validator, you are indicating that you trust them and would like them to be chosen to create the next block. Your SOL coins remain yours, and you can choose to withdraw or delegate your voting rights to a different validator at any time, as we will discuss in the following sections. Follow these steps to stake/delegate SOL coins in Ledger live with your Ledger device: Connect your Ledger device to your computer or phone and open the Solana app on your Ledger device.Your device displays: Application is ready. Open Ledger Live, navigate to the Accounts tab and select your Solana account. In your account, navigate to the Delegations section and click Stake at the top of your screen. Select the Ledger by Figment validator then click Continue. If you do not wish to delegate to the Ledger validator, click on 'Show all' and select a different validator. Note that while there are over 2000 Solana validators, Ledger Live displays only the top 1000 validators for the moment. For the full list of validators, you can consult: https://solscan.io/validator Select the amount of SOL you wish to delegate then click Continue.A prompt appears on your Ledger device. How much SOL should I delegate? To withdraw your staking rewards, you will require SOL in your available balance to cover the transaction costs. Therefore, it is advisable to refrain from delegating your entire balance and instead keep a minimum of 0.01 SOL in your available balance. Review and approve the transaction on your Ledger device.Ledger Live displays: Broadcasting transaction...Ledger Live displays: You have successfully delegated your assets. You're done. Next steps It takes up to 3 days for a delegated/staked SOL balance to become active and start earning rewards. An activating delegation will not get rewards until it's activated: An active delegation will get rewards. You will not see reward transactions in your transaction history, instead, your staking rewards will accrue directly to your delegated balance. Adding SOL coins to an active delegation: The Solana blockchain will not let you add SOL to an active delegated balance. Instead, you can create a new separate delegated balance by using the Add button. Alternatively, you can undelegate your current SOL stake then re-delegate a new balance with a higher amount of SOL. How to monitor your SOL staking rewards with the Earn dashboard in Ledger Live You can easily track your SOL rewards right in Ledger Live using the Earn dashboard. To view this information, simply open Ledger Live, click on the 'Earn' tab, and then find your Solana (SOL) account in the list. Here, you'll see both the amount you've staked and the rewards you've accumulated Undelegating a SOL balance in Ledger Live In Ledger Live, navigate to the Accounts tab and select your Solana account. In the Delegations section, navigate to the delegated balance you wish to undelegate and click Manage > Deactivate. Click Continue.Your device displays: Deactivate stake. Approve the transaction on your Ledger device.Ledger Live displays: You have successfully deactivated your delegation.After a while the status of your delegation will change to Deactivating. What next? It takes 3-4 days for a delegated SOL balance to become inactive. An inactive balance can be reactivated (delegated again) or withdrawn to your available balance (as shown below) to be freely traded or moved out of your Ledger Solana account. Withdrawing your inactive SOL delegation back to your available SOL balance Error while withdrawing SOL: 'Sorry, insufficient funds' The 'Sorry, insufficient funds' error when attempting to withdraw Solana (SOL) stakes occurs if your available (non-staked) balance lacks the necessary SOL to cover the transaction fee. To resolve this, send a small amount of SOL coins to your Solana account and attempt the withdrawal once more. In your Ledger Solana account in Ledger Live, navigate to your inactive balance then select Manage > Withdraw. Select the SOL amount you wish to withdraw then click Continue. Approve the transaction on your Ledger device.Ledger Live displays: You have successfully withdrawn your assets.

Lost / broken / stolen Ledger device In case of damage, loss, or theft of your Ledger wallet device, you can get back access to your accounts thanks to your 24-word recovery phrase by restoring it on a new Ledger device. If you have lost your device, rest assured, your PIN code should prevent any thief to steal your crypto assets. Indeed, after three incorrect PIN codes, your lost Ledger device will get reset to its factory settings, erasing the 24-word recovery phrase it holds. Keep in mind that your 24-word recovery phrase is what is stored on your Ledger device and grants access to your funds. You must never reveal it and never lose it. Issues with managing ERC-20 Tokens You have the power to manage a wide range of ERC20 tokens in Ledger Live. Ledger Live supports numerous ERC20 tokens - you can check out our list of supported crypto assets to see which tokens are included. If a token is not yet supported, don't worry. You can still use your Ledger device to manage them by connecting to a third-party wallet such as MEW, MyCrypto, or MetaMask while we work on adding your token to Ledger Live. How do I receive crypto? Your Ledger device allows you to receive a wide range of crypto assets by generating a receive address in the Ledger Live app. Even if an asset isn't currently supported by Ledger Live, you can still manage it through an external wallet. Simply use your Ledger device to generate a receive address and then use that address in your external wallet to receive the asset. With Ledger, you have a convenient and secure way to manage all of your crypto assets. How do I connect to MetaMask?

Using Your Recovery Phrase with a Software Wallet You might be wondering, 'How is it possible that I can use my recovery phrase with a software wallet? Isn't this my Ledger Recovery phrase?' The answer lies in the fact that recovery phrases are essentially generic, following the BIP-39 standard. This standard ensures compatibility across various wallets, including hardware and software ones. In essence, your recovery phrase is like a key that can open different doors, not just the one on your Ledger device. The Risks of Restoring an Online Wallet with Your Recovery Phrase Restoring your wallet using your recovery phrase in an online environment poses certain risks. Your Ledger recovery phrase is highly secure because it remains offline, away from potential threats like malware and hacks. However, when you input your recovery phrase into an online wallet, you expose it to the digital world. This makes your recovery phrase vulnerable to potential security breaches. It's crucial to understand the risks involved and take necessary precautions when restoring your wallet online. Always ensure you are using a reputable and secure software wallet, and be cautious when entering your recovery phrase on any online platform. Changing your recovery phrase and creating new accounts If you find yourself in a situation where you need immediate access to your funds, it's essential to take steps to secure your assets. One option is to transfer your funds to a temporary, outside account, reset your device, and create a fresh wallet with a 24-word secret recovery phrase. Then, you'd send the funds back to your new accounts in Ledger Live. This can be done by following the steps outlined in our guide on how to change your recovery phrase and create new accounts. Restoring with an existing secret recovery phrase Looking to recover your accounts but facing issues with your current Ledger device? If you are, you can restore access by setting up a new Ledger Nano device using your original recovery phrase. This way, your recovery phrase remains secure while you regain control of your funds. Please remember to handle your recovery phrase with the highest level of caution and only use it when absolutely necessary.

If you encounter this issue while trying to swap or interact with your cryptocurrencies, don't worry! This error simply means that the account from which you are trying to swap the cryptocurrencies does not have enough balance in the native coin to pay for the network fees. For example, when swapping USDC tokens that are in your Ethereum account, you need to have Ethereum (ETH) coin balance on the same Ethereum account to pay for the network fees. It's important to note that network fees are paid to the nodes on the blockchain network to confirm your transaction and are not paid to Ledger. To resolve the issue, follow these steps: Buy some Ethereum (ETH). You can buy ETH directly in Ledger Live through our partners, such as Coinify. Alternatively, you can buy ETH on an exchange like Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to your Ethereum account containing your tokens. Transfer the ETH to the account containing your tokens. Follow the guide provided in Ledger Live to transfer the ETH to the correct account. Once you have enough ETH in the account, you should be able to make the swap successfully.

This issue is commonly encountered during ERC20/BEP20 token or NFT transactions. For a deeper understanding of gas, gas limits, and fee structures on Ethereum and other EVM chains, you can access detailed information here What is Ledger doing to prevent 'out of gas' issues? Ledger Live automatically calculates the optimal fee for your ETH and ERC20 transactions. However, transactions on Ethereum may still fail due to network congestion. Additionally, some smart contracts, particularly those involving ERC20 token transfers, require more gas and could lead to a transaction failure if the gas limit is too low. This can be prevented by using custom Ethereum transactions in Ledger Live. You can learn how to create custom transactions here. How to identify an 'out of gas' issue? If an ERC20 or NFT transaction fails, Ledger Live will display it in your operation history with a 'Failed' status. To investigate further: Click on the failed transaction in Ledger Live to expand it. Select 'View in explorer' to be redirected to Etherscan.io or the corresponding blockchain explorer for your transaction. In the block explorer, look for this error message: 'Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [Out of gas].' This will help you determine if an 'Out of Gas' issue led to the transaction failure. If your transaction did fail due to running out of gas, ensure your Ledger Live account has sufficient fee-paying currency (such as ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.). Then, try resending the transaction in Ledger Live, either by choosing a higher gas fee option for faster processing or waiting for gas fees to decrease. To monitor current gas fees, you can use tools like the 'Gas Tracker' on Etherscan, available at etherscan.io/gastracker to monitor gas fees.

High network fees Once you received some BTC from the exchange (eg. Coinbase, Binance, etc), you may see high network fees for this particular transaction. It is normal to see the high fees for receiving from exchanges. These are so-called payment batching. The process of batching refers to combining multiple payments (withdrawals) into a solitary transaction that has numerous outputs. This method can reduce the data overhead for the transaction, which is the primary factor determining Bitcoin fees.

{"query": "why do my bitcoin transaction has two addresses what is going on", "relevant_passages": ["Change addresses for UTXO-based crypto assets:  Change addresses for UTXO-based crypto assets Bitcoin (BTC) transactions often include two destination addresses: one for the recipient and another as a change address linked to your Ledger account. This system resembles cash transactions and stems from Bitcoin's use of UTXOs to track your BTC balance. This change-address system is also seen in blockchains similar to Bitcoin, which employ UTXO accounting, such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Avalanche X-Chain, Horizen (ZEN) and Zcash (ZEC). However, the change-address system does not apply to accounts like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and many others. For instance, Ethereum (ETH) or XRP addresses are static and remain unchanged after each transaction. How it works When a transaction does not entirely consume the coins it is spending, the difference is known as change. The change is sent back to an automatically generated address called the change address. You can compare UTXO-based transactions with cash. Imagine you buy a hotdog that costs $5 with a $10 bill. In return, you will get a $5 bill of change. This change belongs to you and it will come back to your wallet. In that comparison, your wallet with $5 is a 'change address', still yours but a different bill. The same goes for BTC. Example: John has 1 BTC and sends it to me. Learn more at: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033802154-Change-addresses-for-UTXO-based-crypto-assets", "Receiving address changed:  Receiving address changed Your address for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based crypto assets (such as Zcash (ZEC), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH)) changes every time you receive a transaction. For other crypto assets (Ethereum, XRP, Stellar, etc.) the address stays the same. Bitcoin transactions are public information. Addresses should not be re-used for better privacy. Ledger Live automatically generates new addresses using standards (BIP32/BIP39/BIP44) and keeps track of your previous ones. Previous addresses do remain valid, but they don't offer an optimal level of privacy. Like Bitcoin, Cardano is an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)-based blockchain. This means that once you receive ADA to a Cardano address, the next generated receiving address will be different from the previous one. Learn more about UTXOs. How it works Each of your crypto assets accounts has an extended public key, called an xpub. From this extended public key all your public addresses for that account are generated. Thanks to the xpub you can receive transactions on a new address that belong to the same account. You can find the xpub of an account in Ledger Live by clicking the wrench icon on the account page.

There are many scenarios why this could be happening and this article can't cover all of them but it covers the most common scenarios. Most common scenarios Forgot to include a Memo/Destination tag For some assets like XRP, Stellar, ATOM, HBAR, and others, exchanges require you to insert a memo/destination tag. A Memo or Destination Tag is an additional address property (numeric and/or string) that allows identifying the transfer recipient behind XRP/XLM/ATOM/HBAR address on a centralized exchange. Learn more. This Tag is provided by the exchanges and you need to insert it during the Send operation in Ledger Live. If you already made a transaction without the Tag, your transaction would be still confirmed and the funds would reach the address of the exchange. However, they wont be able to identify and assign the transaction to your exchanges account. As transactions on the blockchain cant be canceled, Ledger wont be able to help you in this situation. Your only solution is to contact the exchanges support and assist them in identifying your deposit transfer. Wrong network of deposit Quite often, your transfer won't appear at the exchange if you selected the wrong network for the deposit of funds. This is a very crucial step since it is very easy to get confused when sending similar assets to the exchange. For example, for EVM assets like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and many others, the system uses the same address format for all the addresses. They all start with 0x... Thus, when sending Ethereum (ETH) to the exchange, Ledger Live won't detect the wrong address format if you send ETH to the Polygon Deposit address. The rule of thumb is to always select the network of the asset you transfer. For example: If your ETH is on the Ethereum network, select Ethereum/ERC20 network for deposit and select this address for transfer. If your ETH is on Optimism network, select Optimism network for deposit Any deviation from the correct network will result in you not seeing the assets at the exchange and you needing to contact the exchange so they can recover your assets. TIP: Not sure if you selected the correct network for the deposit?

I added my Metamask Polygon account to Ledger Live and it shows 0 The Polygon (MATIC) account you created using Metamask and your Ledger Ethereum app or Polygon app might not appear in Ledger Live. What happened? When adding your Ledger Polygon account to Metamask, you were prompted to choose from a list of accounts similar to the one shown below. Each account on this list had an index number starting from number 1. If you did not select the top account (index number 1) as your main Polygon account, your account will likely be hidden in Ledger Live. Why is that? Unlike Metamask, Ledger Live detects accounts sequentially and always starts from index number 1. More on this here. Once an unused account has been detected, Ledger Live will stop detecting additional accounts and display the unused account. As a result, any account that is indexed after an unused account will not show in Ledger Live. How to restore the hidden account in Ledger Live? This can be solved by sending a very small amount of MATIC to every account whose index number is lower than the index of the hidden Polygon account.In the example below, the hidden Polygon account is highlighted in red. In order to make this account appear in Ledger Live, this user would need to send MATIC to the account highlighted in blue. Here are all the steps: Plug your Ledger device into your computer. On your device, open the Polygon (MATIC) app. Open Metamask and connect Metamask to the Polygon network using this tutorial. Connect your Ledger device to Metamask using this tutorial.A list of Ledger Polygon accounts appears. Select and unlock the top (empty) account on the list.

Using Your Recovery Phrase with a Software Wallet You might be wondering, 'How is it possible that I can use my recovery phrase with a software wallet? Isn't this my Ledger Recovery phrase?' The answer lies in the fact that recovery phrases are essentially generic, following the BIP-39 standard. This standard ensures compatibility across various wallets, including hardware and software ones. In essence, your recovery phrase is like a key that can open different doors, not just the one on your Ledger device. The Risks of Restoring an Online Wallet with Your Recovery Phrase Restoring your wallet using your recovery phrase in an online environment poses certain risks. Your Ledger recovery phrase is highly secure because it remains offline, away from potential threats like malware and hacks. However, when you input your recovery phrase into an online wallet, you expose it to the digital world. This makes your recovery phrase vulnerable to potential security breaches. It's crucial to understand the risks involved and take necessary precautions when restoring your wallet online. Always ensure you are using a reputable and secure software wallet, and be cautious when entering your recovery phrase on any online platform. Changing your recovery phrase and creating new accounts If you find yourself in a situation where you need immediate access to your funds, it's essential to take steps to secure your assets. One option is to transfer your funds to a temporary, outside account, reset your device, and create a fresh wallet with a 24-word secret recovery phrase.

To understand more, check out this tutorial on how to change your Ledger PIN . But put simply, if you lose your Ledger, this PIN code will keep access to your crypto safeguarded. How Do I Access My Crypto Without My Hardware Wallet? The other big question that everyone asks if theyre unlucky enough to lose their device is how they will access their crypto, and whether its gone for good. Dont panic – you havent lost your coins and tokens. Crypto is all about freedom, and that means that nobody – not even your wallet provider – can stand between you and your blockchain assets. Recovery Phrase: Your All Important Back-Up When you first set up a Ledger device, it will prompt you to write down a list of 24 words, a recovery phrase or seed phrase. These words are important to note down in order, and keep safe. Put simply, they are a mnemonic representation of all the private keys you will ever secure on that device. Think of them something like a back-up of your private keys. For example, imagine you have assets at three different blockchain addresses you are managing with your Ledger device. The recovery phrase on your device will act as the shorthand for the three private keys for each address. If you are controlling 25 blockchain addresses with your device, then the recovery phrase represents the keys of all 25 addresses. Therefore, your assets are only as safe as this recovery phrase is. Thus even without the device itself, you can still access your crypto, as long as you have stored this phrase safely. So, if you lose your device, you can simply enter your 24 words into a new hardware wallet. This will recover everything from your lost device. Taking responsibility for your recovery phrase is one of the most important considerations youll have as a crypto owner. If you dont have that phrase, or youve noted it down wrong – your crypto really is gone. Attention to detail is your friend here. The Best Way to Back Up your Ledger Device Beyond setting yourself up for success with your PIN code and recovery phrase management, theres another pretty simple way to back up your device in case it ever gets stolen. Simply, you can set up a back-up device. How does a Back-up Device Work? Using a back-up Ledger device is the easiest and most effective way of insuring yourself against loss and theft of your main device. Doing this is easy: simply recover your existing device on a second back-up Ledger, by selecting restore device, then enter your existing 24 words. This will recover all of your existing crypto accounts on this second device, making it an exact replica of your main one. From there, you can then store your back-up wallet in a safe place and forget about it. If you ever lose your main device, no problem. All you have to do is get your back-up, and voila! Youre right back in the driving seat with your crypto. This is not to say you shouldnt store your 24 words safely. But having both your words, and a fully functional back-up device, means nothing can come between you and your crypto. Losing Your Ledger Device Does Not Mean Losing your Crypto So there you have it – did you lose your Ledger device? No problem! Losing your Ledger device does not mean losing your crypto! Your PIN – which only you can ever know – prevents anyone else from using the device. Then, your recovery phrase keeps you linked with your precious blockchain addresses. Nobody can access your crypto – and you still can. Losing your hardware wallet is nobodys idea of fun. But staying secure is not about hoping for the best – its about making sure youre covered even when the worst happens. And with Ledger hardware wallets, that security is built into the user design. So go forth, be mobile, play, trade, buy, sell and travel with your Ledger device – with a little attention to detail, your crypto security is watertight, no matter what.

{"query": "Is it safe to purchase a Ledger wallet from a reseller, or should I buy directly from the official website?", "relevant_passages": ["buying a ledger from a third party: As a person acting as their own bank and taking responsibility for their own security. In this article, we will walk you through the process of checking the authenticity of your Ledger device, empowering you to check that its genuine no matter where you bought it. Ready? HWG! Why Use a Ledger Hardware Wallet Anyway? Owning crypto means controlling the private keys for your blockchain addresses – if anyone else can access those keys, consider your assets gone. So how you secure them will define the security of your valuable crypto assets. Weve said it before and well say it again : Ledger Hardware Wallets are the most secure option for protecting your crypto. Why? Because the biggest threats to your crypto exist online. Using a hot wallet to secure your private keys cant protect you against online threats, which also exist on a connected device. That means clever hackers can target your wallet (and private keys) via your internet connection. Not so secure after all, right? So the only way of truly securing your private keys is by ensuring they are never online. This is exactly what the Ledger hardware wallet does. The keys (and seed phrase) are generated offline from the beginning, within the device; they are secured within the device at all times. Even when youre transacting with an online platform, the transaction is signed within your Ledger device, and not online. All of this means that your keys are never, ever online – and they are completely out of reach of hackers. Trusting Your Hardware Wallet is Essential So to recap, Ledger s hardware wallets are security devices that you trust with your most precious data – your private keys. With that in mind, there are three things you need to know to be sure your device is safe. One is that the device itself is genuine, the second is that it has not been tampered with, and the Ledger Live interface youre interacting with is genuine. Heres how to verify all three of these things for yourself. Even when youre buying from a third-party vendor, so you can secure your crypto in peace. Buy a Ledger Hardware Wallet From a Third Party Lets start from the top. A common concern is that a Ledger device cannot be bought securely from a third-party vendor. In reality, you have a few different options if buying directly from Ledger isnt possible. The Ledger device is stocked on Amazon and Best Buy . There is even a list of official resellers on the Ledger website. That being said, if you want to buy a Ledger wallet from a third party, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. Our reseller list is there for a reason! Only authorized sellers can guarantee that youre getting a genuine Ledger product. We oversee the supply ourselves and can vouch for the product being genuine. So this is a great starting point for ensuring the safety of your product. Another thing to bear in mind is logistics: whatever seller you decide to use, make sure that they ship to your country. Now thats out of the way, lets get down to the details. How To Check Your Ledger Device So youve checked our re-seller list and purchased your shiny new Ledger, and now you have it in your hands. Whats next? Ledgers built-in genuine check puts the power in your hands from the first moment, by allowing you to personally verify your device. So lets look at the various reference points you can use to do that. Step 1 – Has Your Device Been Tampered With? Visual Checks The moment your device arrives, you can do a few basic visual checks to establish that nothing is out of place. These include: Checking the condition of the box, ensuring it is not damaged and not open Checking the box contents are neatly in place Checking the condition of the Recovery sheet – it should be empty Assessing the initial state of the Ledger device. From there, its time to move on to the more technical side of things. Has Your Wallet Been Pre-seeded? When you set up your Ledger device, part of the process is generating a 24-word recovery phrase . Your recovery phrase is critically important to the security of your crypto. If someone else were to know it, they would be able to steal all your crypto assets secured by your Ledger device . So how can you be sure only you know the phrase? Because you – only you – are in charge of generating the phrase in the first place. Writing it down on the recovery phase sheet that comes with your device. This sheet is one part of your security check: if it has already been filled in with words, this means your device has been tampered with and is absolutely not safe to use. This is known as pre-seeding, a scam that takes advantage of your lack of experience with hardware wallets. Pre-seeding is when someone else enters the seed phrase for their own wallet onto your recovery phrase sheet, in the hopes that youll enter it into your device. Doing this gives that person complete control of whatever you store on your device from that point.

This is where Ledger and its growing ecosystem comes in. Lets have a look at Ledgers mission, philosophy, tools and interface to show how they can benefit you on your crypto journey. Why choose Ledger? The concept of ownership is changing, and here at Ledger, were ready for it. Crypto is about giving power back to the people; by decentralizing the traditional financial system, it removes big banks and governments from finance, putting you back in charge of your financial decisions. However, some crypto management solutions trade decentralization for convenience and accessibility, like crypto exchanges , software or online wallets. Although theyre easy to use, those solutions act as new intermediaries, with new compromises, such as the data you need to give, and the access you have to your funds. And theres another problem too – trusted third parties have security flaws . By using them, you put the safety of your crypto in their hands, and trust their systems. Why would you trust someone else with your assets, when you could have peace of mind by protecting them yourself? Thats where blockchain changes everything. You can think of blockchain as an enormous digital storage space, where you can own assets, without relying on a middleman. And your wallet is the interface you use to communicate with that digital infrastructure and keep your assets secure, which makes it critical to your ownership. At Ledger, our wallets put security and freedom first. Because we believe you should remain the only one in charge of your money. What does Ledger offer users? Our Ecosystem explained Crypto users need both security and ease of use. So we created an ecosystem of products and services that enables you to easily secure your private keys in the safest possible way, while also enabling you to manage your crypto seamlessly. Ledger hardware wallets combined with the Ledger Live application are the best solution for securing your funds while remaining in control. Lets take a look at why. Security Remember those all important private keys? The entire point of Ledgers hardware wallet is to offer the best possible security for those keys, by keeping them offline. Always. Whereas hot wallets generate your private keys online, and also store them within a system that is always connected, the Ledger Nano generates your private keys within the device itself, and stores them there too. This means your keys will never – ever – be exposed to online threats such as hacks and malware, and you also dont need to entrust them to another entity. Simplicity OK – so crypto security with Ledger is a no-brainer: your keys stay offline, and that alone changes the playing field when it comes to safely managing your assets. But what about ease of use – how can you transact with a Nano, when its not connected to the internet? The answer is Ledger Live. Ledger Live is our native app that works in tandem with your Nano. Its an online interface where you can visualise and manage your crypto assets, and interact with a range of external platforms using the funds youve secured with your wallet. So whether you want to send or receive crypto, or simply check the balance of your accounts, you can do that easily on our app, while your keys stay securely within the device itself. How can I access Ledger Live? Conceptually speaking, Ledger hardware wallets combined with the Ledger Live app are like iPhones and the App store: on one side there is a device that allows you to store your assets, and on the other side is the software that helps you manage your assets and access a wide variety of services. Simple, right? Ledger Live automatically comes with every Nano wallet purchased. They are like two sides of the same coin. For instance, for each action you want to operate, you need both Ledger Live, as well as your Nano wallet to verify and confirm the same transaction, it is quite similar to 2FA mechanisms.

However, we do not recommend importing a 12-word secret phrase that was generated by a software wallet such as Metamask, Phantom, Keplr, Electrum, etc. Recovery phrases created by software wallets are digitally generated and are therefore less secure. On the other hand, if your 12-word recovery phrase was originally created by another hardware wallet like a Trezor One, it is safe to import it into your Ledger device and continue using the same accounts.

If you need to re-add your accounts on your smartphone, you can import them via QR code with Ledger Live desktop. Learn more Zero balance after adding an account in Ledger Live? If you added an account in Ledger Live and you see a zero balance without transaction history, you are most likely not using the correct recovery phrase associated with the account you are trying to find. Likely, at some point, your device has got reset and you set it up with a new 24-word recovery phrase. Your device, therefore, manages a new set of accounts. To manage your existing set of accounts, you will have to restore your device from your previous 24-word recovery phrase. You can do this by following the instructions from this article.

{"query": "I have read somewhere that Ledger can technically know the 24 recovery phrases, because the source code is not open which means no one knows what Ledger is doing with the 24 word phrases?", "relevant_passages": ["How Ledger device generates 24-word recovery phrase:  How Ledger device generates 24-word recovery phrase The recovery phrase is the key to managing your crypto assets. As such, the recovery phrase should be something that is long and nearly impossible for anyone to guess. Your recovery phrase isnt like a password or a PIN (Ledger devices already have PINs to protect access to them), instead, its the root of all of your cryptographic secrets. Once your device randomly generates it for the first time and you write it down on paper, you will only need to access it if you have to recover your device. Ledger uses a standard called BIP 39 for the generation and interpretation of the recovery phrase on all of our devices. BIP 39 is an industry-standard used by many other hierarchical deterministic wallets. The exact type of BIP 39 seed used by Ledger devices by default is a 24-word mnemonic that consists of only the 2048 words from the BIP 39 English wordlist. Heres how a BIP 39 24-word mnemonic seed is generated: The device generates a sequence of 256 random bits using the True Random Number Generator (TRNG) built into the devices Secure Element. The first 8 bits of the SHA-256 hash of the initial 256 bits are appended to the end, giving us 264 bits All 264 bits are split into 24 groups of 11 bits Each group of 11 bits is interpreted as a number in the range 0 - 2047, which serves as an index to the BIP 39 wordlist, giving us 24 words. It's important to note that although a Ledger device can be restored using a recovery phrase of 12, 18, or 24 words, Ledger devices only generate 24-word recovery phrases. They do not create phrases of 12 or 18 words. The result of this process is that your device will generate a single mnemonic seed out of 2256 possible mnemonic seeds (Thats one of 115 792 089 237 316 195 423 570 985 008 687 907 853 269 984 665 640 564 039 457 584 007 913 129 639 936 possible mnemonic seeds). Note that while the first 23 words are completely random, the final word is derived from 3 random bits and 8 calculated bits from the SHA-256 hash.

How to protect your recovery phrase? Your 24-word recovery phrase (sometimes called a mnemonic or seed phrase) is the master key to all your crypto accounts. Anyone gaining access to your recovery phrase can very easily clone your accounts on their own device (or software wallet) and spend your funds. As such, it's very important to keep your phrase secure and private at all times. Does Ledger Support need my recovery phrase to help me solve technical issues? No, the Ledger Support team does not need to know your 24-word recovery phrase to help you. Anyone trying to access your recovery phrase should be considered a scammer. Please never share your recovery phrase with anyone, including Ledger. Here's a list of tips to help you custody your recovery phrase securely: Ensure that your 24-word recovery phrase is obtained from your Ledger device's screen during the initial setup. Your recovery words do not come in the box. The set of recovery sheets included in the box should be blank. Do not make a digital copy of your recovery phrase. Do not take a picture of your phrase. Do not save your phrase into a password manager. Your recovery phrase needs to stay strictly offline. When first writing down your recovery phrase, make sure to number each word correctly. Use a ballpen and not a pencil. Use capital letters, they are easier to read. Make sure each recovery word is correctly spelled by using the BIP-39 list. Always keep a physical copy of your recovery phrase. Memorizing your recovery phrase is not a safe strategy for long-term cold storage Consider backing up your recovery phrase with a Crypto Steel Capsule Solo. Do not scramble your recovery words. Do not seed your Ledger 24-word recovery phrase into Metamask. This would compromise your phrase. Do not seed your Metamask 12-word recovery phrase into your Ledger device. Your Metamask recovery phrase was generated online. As such, it is not secure. Seeding it into your Ledger device would compromise all the Ledger accounts that are derived from that recovery phrase. Be cautious of scams falsely promoted as Ledger endorsements. Ledger never supports airdrops which can be covers for scams aiming at tricking you into revealing your recovery phrase. If an offer seems too good to be true, it likely is.

To solve this problem, Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 (BIP-39) introduced a standardized method to translate that long number into something more easily recorded by a human. Using this method, there are a total of 2048 English words that your Secret Recovery Phrase may use to translate the entropy. At this point, you might be wondering; if its just a literal translation of a long number, what makes a secret recovery secure? Well, actually, thats more to do with how the entropy was generated. To explain, the entropy must be very long and random, otherwise someone might be able to guess it. As long as the entropy is chosen at random and made up of more than 128 bits, its sufficiently secure that no person or computer will be able to crack it. Ledger Secret Recovery Phrases Explained Ledger devices use a Random Number Generator (RNG) to generate the entropy, so its extremely random. Plus, all ledger devices use a 24 word recovery phrase, which translates into 256 bits of entropy—sufficiently long that guessing the combination is impossible. Initiating the generation process on a Ledger goes as follows: Turn on your Ledger device Set a personal PIN code Your Device generates a random long number, a.k.a. The entropy The entropy is translated into your Secret Recovery Phrase using BIP-39 The Secret Recovery Phrase is displayed on your Trusted Display If you ever receive a device containing a pre-completed Secret Recovery Phrase or PIN code, do not use the device! It may mean that the device is pre-owned, or possibly even tampered with. Under these circumstances, contact Ledger customer support for more information. How Can I Keep My Secret Recovery Phrase Safe? So, now you know that your Secret Recovery Phrase is a backup to all of your crypto wallet. This also means that if anyone else can get their hands on your set of 24 words, they can access your cryptocurrencies. As such, its extremely important to keep your Secret Recovery Phrase secure. So what can you do to protect it? Make Sure You Record It Correctly Firstly, you want to make sure you write down or record your Secret Recovery Phrase correctly. Any error in spelling or word order would cause a different set of addresses to be generated. To lend a hand with this, Ledger has developed a dedicated application. The Recovery Check app lets you check if the recovery phrase you wrote down matches the one protecting your device. Easy! Store It Offline Next, you should never store your SRP on cloud-based services. If the server is hacked, your Secret Recovery Phrase—and therefore your wallet—could become compromised. Similarly, you should never transact while using software wallets on devices using shared wifi networks. You wouldnt want to share your Secret Recovery Phrase with everyone on the airport wifi, would you? Well, keeping a copy of your SRP on an internet-connected device is asking for exactly that. Recording your SRP on something physical— be that a hardware wallet or a piece of paper—is a much better option. At this point its important to mention that you should never restore your hardware wallets Secret Recovery Phrase into a software wallet . To explain, the entire point of a hardware wallet is that it generates your Secret Recovery Phrase completely offline. This means not even the most sophisticated digital spyware could see those words. If you enter that same secure recovery phrase into a wallet that doesnt have those same qualities, you risk exposing it. In short, if you import your hardware wallet into a software wallet, your secret recovery phrase might be vulnerable to online threats. Store It Somewhere Away From Thieves, Accidents and Natural Disasters To follow, you should also bear in mind where you store your SRP physically. If someone steals your SRP sheet, they can easily access your wallet. Thus, no one should know your secret hiding place—not your mom, not your wife, and certainly not your housemates. In the cases where you have no safe place to store your SRP, you may be interested in Ledger Recover. The paid optional service allows users to back up their Secret Recovery Phrases by fragmenting and distributing them to custodians. In short, this removes the burden of protecting your SRP at home.

Ledger is uncompromising on security, and that will never change – Charles Guillemet Ledger CTO Security is paramount to both Coincover and Ledger. As a result, all of Ledger Recovers identity verification providers use multiple-encryption layers, with each party storing the encrypted fragments of your private key on Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) . In short, these Hardware Security Modules are basically the same technology as the one in Ledger devices,but they use servers installed into data centers with more computation power. Finally, Ledger Recover has undergone independent security audits to check and test its processes. That means you can rest assured that the encrypted fragments of your secret recovery phrase are in safe hands. Can Ledger Recover Be Exploited To Steal My Secret Recovery Phrase? Firstly, your Secret Recovery Phrase will never leave the Secure Element chip. Only encrypted fragments of it leave the device only if you choose to subscribe to Ledger Recover, and these fragments are useless alone. Even if a bad actor got hold of an encrypted fragment of your secret Recovery phrase, they wouldnt be able to do anything with it. Even the most sophisticated hacker couldnt reconstitute it! Plus, your Ledger will only allow your Secret Recovery Phrase to leave the wallet as encrypted fragments when you give it permission. Setting up Ledger Recover requires you to enter a PIN and consent to starting the process on the device. Without your permission, the device will not (and cannot) fragment or send the encrypted fragments anywhere. That means if someone wants to exploit Ledger Recover to steal your secret recovery phrase, they would need to have your PIN in the first place, which would already give them access to your wallet. However, should someone steal your funds using Ledger Recover, Coincover offers users $50,000 in compensation – That just goes to show the confidence in the products security. How Can I Start Using Ledger Recover? When it launches, you can start using Ledger recover via your Ledger Live app. From there, in the My Ledger section, youll need to create a Ledger Recover account, add a credit or debit card, verify your identity with our verification partner Onfido, and then proceed backing-up your Secret Recovery Phrase. Following that, you can rest assured that your Secret Recovery Phrase is safe to retrieve whenever you request it. Its important to note that Ledger Recover is a paid optional service that protects your secret recovery phrase for $9.99 a month. However, you can also decide to unsubscribe any time you like to and decide to manage your secret recovery phrase yourself. For the time being, Ledger Recover is available to Ledger customers in EU countries, the UK, Canada, and the USA with a Ledger Nano X or Ledger Nano S Plus. However, it will become available to all Ledger customers in an increasing number of regions soon. Does Ledger Recover Affect me? Maybe youre not sure about Ledger Recover, dont want to subscribe, and are wondering how it affects you. If you already have a Ledger device with the new firmware update — fear not! Ledger Recover is a completely optional feature. If you already use a Ledger but would rather look after your Secret Recovery Phrase yourself — you can. Managing safely your own Secret Recovery Phrase is still completely necessary and recommended, by Ledger.

There are many scenarios why this could be happening and this article can't cover all of them but it covers the most common scenarios. Most common scenarios Forgot to include a Memo/Destination tag For some assets like XRP, Stellar, ATOM, HBAR, and others, exchanges require you to insert a memo/destination tag. A Memo or Destination Tag is an additional address property (numeric and/or string) that allows identifying the transfer recipient behind XRP/XLM/ATOM/HBAR address on a centralized exchange. Learn more. This Tag is provided by the exchanges and you need to insert it during the Send operation in Ledger Live. If you already made a transaction without the Tag, your transaction would be still confirmed and the funds would reach the address of the exchange. However, they wont be able to identify and assign the transaction to your exchanges account. As transactions on the blockchain cant be canceled, Ledger wont be able to help you in this situation. Your only solution is to contact the exchanges support and assist them in identifying your deposit transfer. Wrong network of deposit Quite often, your transfer won't appear at the exchange if you selected the wrong network for the deposit of funds. This is a very crucial step since it is very easy to get confused when sending similar assets to the exchange. For example, for EVM assets like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and many others, the system uses the same address format for all the addresses. They all start with 0x... Thus, when sending Ethereum (ETH) to the exchange, Ledger Live won't detect the wrong address format if you send ETH to the Polygon Deposit address. The rule of thumb is to always select the network of the asset you transfer. For example: If your ETH is on the Ethereum network, select Ethereum/ERC20 network for deposit and select this address for transfer. If your ETH is on Optimism network, select Optimism network for deposit Any deviation from the correct network will result in you not seeing the assets at the exchange and you needing to contact the exchange so they can recover your assets.

Do I need a destination tag/ID to send XRP to my Ledger device? No, destination tags (sometimes called memo tags or memo IDs) are only needed to send funds from your Ledger XRP account to an exchange (like Binance or Coinbase) or to send XRP between two exchanges (for example: Binance to Coinbase). When sending XRP from an exchange to your Ledger device you can leave the memo field blank or type in any random string of characters (for example '1111'). Do I need a destination tag/ID to send XRP to an exchange? Yes, it's important to include a destination tag when sending XRP funds from your Ledger XRP account to an exchange account. Exchanges need tags to credit XRP deposits to the correct accounts. You can learn how to attach a destination tag to an XRP transaction here. I forgot to attach a destination tag to my transaction, what can I do? Don't worry, your funds are not lost and can be recovered by the exchange. Please reach out to the exchange's support team directly. In your email, make sure to include the transaction ID in plain text (no screenshots). Please note that some exchanges will charge you a small fee to recover your XRP. I just received a very small XRP transaction, what happened? This could be a dusting attack. Despite its ominous name, a dusting attack is not a direct threat to your XRP funds but often the work of a malicious third-party trying to spy on your account activity. Since all blockchain accounts are public by nature, anyone can select a random sample of XRP addresses and send dust funds to them. Dusting attacks are sometimes followed by phishing attacks or contain malicious links attached as memo. If you're the victim of a dusting attack, don't panic.

If buying an NFT sounds like the perfect gift solution, but youre a first-timer – don worry because we have you covered! Here, we explain how to buy, store and gift an NFT using your Ledger Nano and Ledgers secure ecosystem. Step 1: Fund your ETH (Ethereum) in Ledger Live Most NFTs are Ethereum-based digital tokens. Therefore most of the big NFT marketplaces will only accept ETH: so first, youll need to make sure you have some in your Ledger Wallet. To do this, go into your Ethereum wallet within your Ledger Live account. From here, youll have two options: if youve already bought some ETH on an exchange and its still in the exchange wallet, you can receive it to your Ledger Account by clicking the receive button. This will take you through the process of transferring those funds to your Ledger Wallet. But if you still need to buy some ETH, by far the safest way of doing this is using the Buy function on Ledger Live (which also appears on this same screen). Whats really useful about this function is that it allows you to purchase crypto and have it sent directly to your Nano – it means youll never need to rely on a hot wallet on an exchange, where you dont own the private keys and the exchange has ultimate control. By purchasing Ethereum through Coinify on Ledgers own ecosystem, your tokens will go directly to your Ledger Nano wallet, leaving you in complete control of your funds from start to finish. Step 2: Choose an NFT marketplace There are lots of different NFT marketplaces, and the one you use really depends on what youre looking for. Platforms like OpenSea and Rarible are affectionately known as the Amazon of NFTs. Why? Learn more at: https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-to-gift-an-nft"]}

Did you know you can increase your security with a backup device? Having a hardware wallet is a great way to secure your crypto assets. You can increase this security by having a second in case of theft, damage or loss. Equally, this would reduce the risk that losing a recovery sheet might bring or perhaps you share a cryptocurrency account with a relative. There are several reasons for potentially having or wanting a second hardware wallet, which you would use as a backup. What would you do if you lose your precious device? Of course, you can always restore it using your 24-word recovery phrase, but what if that has been lost or had been noted incorrectly? A backup could add another layer of security for you. Even for flexibility, there can be several reasons for wanting a backup device. Underneath here, we will list some of the possible uses for it. Loss or Destruction When you lose your device or should it malfunction due to being damaged, having a backup device enables you to have access to your crypto assets still. In case of theft, it is recommended to rapidly move your crypto assets so that no one would be able to access them. With a backup device, you would be able to have quick access and move your crypto assets if needed. After this, you can reset your hardware wallet to use it safely once again. If you have one Ledger hardware wallet, you already have a form of backup: the 24-word recovery phrase. This too, however, could get lost or destroyed. In worst-case scenarios, a flood or fire could make short work of your recovery sheet. Much like a Ledger device, a recovery sheet could be lost as well. Having a backup device stored in a different location would mitigate this threat. Having Quick Access There are two different use cases for wanting quick access. One is convenience, whereas the other concerns the security of your crypto assets. Many of our users have already noticed the ease of the Ledger Nano Xs usability. It provides easy access to your crypto assets through a smartphone at any time. By having two devices, a Ledger Nano X can be taken with you anywhere you go. The Ledger Nano S can be kept for at-home use or kept in a safe location. Multi-use Backup Device With a backup device, you can have dedicated devices. Your first Ledger Nano S or Ledger Nano X could be used for certain crypto assets, while your second device could be used for the utility apps, such as the Password Manager, Hello , Recovery Check and U2F . Or perhaps youd want to use the second device for other crypto assets than the first one. So that you have a specific device depending on the asset you want to use. Another case we see often is two individuals sharing one account. In this way, the two could each have their own device and access the crypto assets as desired.

You can purchase a new device via our store. Creating and transferring your funds to new accounts. Is there another option? Although it is strongly recommended to transfer your funds to new accounts, it is not obligatory. Your lost/stolen device is secured by a PIN code and will automatically reset after three incorrect attempts. If you are confident that your PIN is strong enough to withstand brute force attacks, you can simply restore your 24-word recovery phrase into your new/backup Ledger device to regain access to your accounts immediately. However, if your lost device lacks a robust PIN it is crucial to create new accounts and modify your recovery phrase as explained below. 1- Immediately send your remaining crypto assets to temporary accounts First ensure your backup/new device is configured with the recovery phrase that secures your accounts. Next, using Ledger Live and your backup/new device, send all your remaining crypto assets to temporary accounts. Those can be accounts created on a crypto exchange, a software wallet or any account linked to another hardware wallet. 2- Remove or rename all your accounts from Ledger Live Once you're done transferring your crypto to temporary accounts, it's recommended to remove your—now empty—accounts from Ledger Live.

Please advise", "relevant_passages": ["the importance of certification:  What is Security Certification? By Kirsty Moreland Oct 23, 2019 | Updated May 16, 2023 Read 2 min Beginner SHARE KEY TAKEAWAYS: — Security certification is an objective assessment of a product by a third party to show that it has attained a particular security standard. — There are multiple different security certification levels, denoting different evaluations undergone by the product. — The purpose of certification is to provide users with a reliable and objective metric for judging the security of a given product. Security certification is an incredibly important feature of crypto hardware – yet you might be asking yourself, just what is security certification? Here, we explain the concept – and why it is so essential. Generally speaking, certification is used to show that a product has undergone assessment by a third party and has reached a certain standard. When speaking about security technology, certification is used to show that a specific hardware or software has undergone extensive testing and meets a certain security standard. Our Ledger hardware wallets use state-of-the-art Secure Element chips , which are used for high-end security solutions for protecting critical data such as credit cards, passports and sim cards. These chips are certified for their high security level. For these applications, having this level of security is a third-party requirement. For hardware wallets, no such requirement exists. At Ledger, we believe it is our responsibility to provide the highest level of security. The Secure Elements used in Ledger devices have passed a Common Criteria security evaluation – an international standard for banking cards and state requirements – and have obtained an EAL5+ certificate. What are the EAL certification levels? There are seven different levels of EAL, which is the abbreviation for Evaluation Assurance Level . As mentioned, the EAL level of the Secure Elements we use is 5+. In this framework, the threat model considers remote and physical access for the attacker. During the EAL evaluation process, there are several elements taken into consideration such as: – Life cycle / supply chain – Development procedure – Documentation – Functional test – Penetration test Reaching EAL 5+ ensures having t he highest level of security against penetration tests. Going beyond EAL 5+ does not provide a higher assurance against attacks anymore. There are many types of certifications. The EAL is an internationally recognized, most renowned certificate, but national and even local certificates may exist. Why is certification important? Anyone can claim to have a secure device, but it is difficult to trust this claim. Through certificates, an independent third party has assessed the claim. At Ledger, we believe security is paramount, and while anyone can claim to have a secure product, it means much more coming from a trusted third party. This is an important milestone for Ledger in our effort to certify all our B2C and B2B products. What does Ledger do regarding certification? Today, both Ledger Nano X and Ledger Nano S are the only hardware wallets to be independently certified, according to the security requirements specified in the CSPN (First Level Security Certification) security certification scheme. This certification serves as an external, third-party confirmation that Ledgers security is industry-leading. This external and independent assessment further validates the companys commitment to industry-leading security. Ledger constantly looks to enhance the security of its products, leveraging both external security researchers in its Bounty Program , as well as its industry-leading, in-house Attack Lab, the Ledger Donjon . Ledger has developed a robust custom Operating System, namely BOLOS and crypto-asset apps run on top of this secure hardware. Its this combination of software and hardware that brings the highest level of security to each of the companys products.

{"query": "On my older ledger device, I downloaded the new software and now theres too much memory taken up and one of my wallets got erased due to not enough space. Is that crypto gone forever now?", "relevant_passages": ["Insufficient device storage: How much memory does my device have? When using Ledger hardware wallets, the available storage capacity varies depending on the model you have. For example, the Ledger Nano S Plus offers 1.5 MB of storage space, while the Ledger Nano X provides 2 MB. This storage space is primarily used to install applications for different cryptocurrencies, and the number of applications you can have is limited by each app's size. Each device can hold up to 100 apps. Explore our device specifications here. How much crypto can I store? The storage capacity of a Ledger device does not determine the amount of cryptocurrency it can 'hold.' Instead, our hardware wallets securely store your private keys offline, which are essential for accessing your cryptocurrencies on the blockchain. The actual cryptocurrencies are not stored on the device itself, but rather, on the respective blockchains. Important note While Ledger devices may store up to 2 MB of apps, this storage capacity is not correlated to the amount of a specific asset you own. This means you can hold a small fraction of a Bitcoin or the entire amount in circulation. Owning cryptocurrency grants you a private key, which serves as the means to sign transactions and access your crypto assets on the blockchain. A Ledger device, like the Ledger Nano S Plus or X, functions as a hardware wallet designed to safeguard your private keys offline. When conducting a transaction, the device internally signs it, ensuring your private keys remain protected from any online exposure. This added security layer effectively shields your assets from potential hacks and theft. As a result, the amount of cryptocurrency you can manage with a Ledger device is not constrained by its storage capacity. Instead, you can conveniently and securely manage an almost unlimited amount of cryptocurrencies using our devices, ensuring your digital assets remain safe, secure and easy to manage.

{"query": "Can I mint my own NFTs directly through my Ledger wallet, or do I need to use a third-party service?", "relevant_passages": ["mint nft: This means your private keys are safe from hacks and malware. Set up an Account Within your Wallet Once you have a crypto wallet, youll need to create an account to mint your token. NFTs exist on different blockchains, so youll need to have an account for your blockchain of choice set up before minting. If youre minting an asset based on the Ethereum blockchain, for example, youll need to create an Ethereum address within your crypto wallet. On the other hand, if youre minting from a different blockchain, such as Tezos or Solana, youll need to ensure you have an account set up on that network (and in all cases, youll need to ensure your middleware corresponds with the blockchain too). 2) Do You Need a Web3 Browser Extension (Middleware)? Web3 dApps (and NFTs) are powered by an infrastructure known as smart contracts . Since this is a different ‘scaffolding from Web2, youll need a special browser thats equipped to navigate these new options. Similarly, if youre looking to own NFTs, your wallet needs to be able to talk to their underlying smart contract. Many software wallets are also Web3 browser extensions. They are equipped to interact with smart contracts and navigate Web3s architecture. These type of wallets can easily interact with NFTs. However, they remain limited in safety when it comes to securing the private key. Hardware devices, on the other hand, may not be able to interact with smart contracts on their own. You can connect your hardware device to a Web3 browser extension that is compatible with the blockchain youre using. Utilizing the extension as a middleware so that your wallet can communicate with smart contracts on that network. This means youll be able to manage your NFTs, while properly securing their private key – the sweet spot. To understand how to connect your Ledger with Web3 middleware, check out this article . 3) Buy Some Crypto Every NFT mint will have a price – be it fixed in advance via an allow list , or determined by the highest bidders at auction. However youre purchasing, there are a couple of ways you can buy the crypto you need. Depending on what crypto youre paying with, you may be able to visit a centralized exchange, and buy it via your debit card. Youll then send this crypto from your exchange wallet to your Web3 wallet, ready to pay for your NFT as you mint. Alternatively, you can buy crypto via an API and receive it directly to your Web3 wallet. If you own a Ledger, for example, you can buy directly from one of our partners, such as Moonpay. 4) Find out when the drop happens – and if theres an allow list Minting an NFT from a drop can be tricky. Limited supply combined with a lot of buzz means stiff competition. Learn more at: https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/nfts/mint-nft", "mint nft: Lets get started. What Does Minting Mean? Lets start at the beginning – what exactly does it mean to mint an NFT? Simply put, minting means making a digital asset come to life on a blockchain network. This means it can be bought and sold, and effectively owned via the blockchain. Minting can be thought of as the birth of that token. Artists and creators might mint their work as an NFT, for example. Issuing that work onto the blockchain enables them to display the work on their marketplace profile, and of course, trade it as an asset. When new NFT collections are dropped , minting refers to buyers purchasing a token from that new collection as it launches, directly from the smart contract. This is the process well deal with in todays article. What Youll Need to Mint an NFT Before you can mint an NFT from a new collection, there are a couple of things youll need: A crypto/NFT wallet (to manage the private keys for your new asset) A Web3 browser extension, where your wallet is not smart-contract enabled Enough crypto to pay both the asset and other costs such as gas fees Alpha on the terms of the drop Lets cover all of those now. 1) Choose a Crypto Wallet As with any blockchain-based asset owning an NFT really means controlling its private key. The security of that private key depends on your crypto wallet. Software Wallets Software wallets secure private keys digitally, and can easily interact with dApps. This makes them a popular choice for NFT users, since you can easily interact with the tokens underlying smart contract. However, securing your NFTs with a software wallet comes with a caveat: since it stores your private key on your computer or phone, your key will always be vulnerable to threats. Your private key may well be concealed, and easy to manage, but it will never be totally safe from malware. Hardware Wallets Using a hardware wallet, such as a Ledger, negates this risk altogether. Your private key is stored within the device itself, keeping it completely segregated from your internet connection.

Installing Ledger Live on a new device Did you install Ledger Live on a new device and you cant see your existing accounts? This is normal. Ledger Live does not use a centralized database with your accounts and settings, these information are stored locally on your computer or smartphone. Therefore, you will have to re-add your accounts each time you install Ledger Live on a new device or if your Ledger Live gets reset. If your Ledger Live app is newly installed or was recently reset, the 'Accounts' tab may appear greyed out and inaccessible. In this case, first, select the 'Portfolio' section, then click on 'Add account' to start manually re-adding your accounts with your Ledger device. Remember, your crypto is always stored on the blockchain, not on Ledger Live. When you add accounts in Ledger Live, Ledger Live scans the accounts linked to the 24-word recovery phrase currently stored on your Ledger device. Your existing accounts should then appear. If you need to re-add your accounts on your smartphone, you can import them via QR code with Ledger Live desktop. Learn more Zero balance after adding an account in Ledger Live? If you added an account in Ledger Live and you see a zero balance without transaction history, you are most likely not using the correct recovery phrase associated with the account you are trying to find. Likely, at some point, your device has got reset and you set it up with a new 24-word recovery phrase. Your device, therefore, manages a new set of accounts. To manage your existing set of accounts, you will have to restore your device from your previous 24-word recovery phrase. You can do this by following the instructions from this article.

'You first need to send at least 0.1 TRX to this address to enable TRC20 deposit.' These notifications are due to the Tron protocol's requirement to activate your account before receiving any Tron tokens, such as USDT Tether or USDC. Activation requires transferring at least 0.1 TRX coins to your new Tron account, which can be done before or after you've sent your tokens. If you see one of these messages in Ledger Live: To receive TRC10/TRC20 tokens, send a minimum of 0.1 TRX coins to your new Tron account in Ledger Live. This initial funding activates your account on the Tron blockchain, allowing you to receive your tokens. If you've already sent tokens like USDT Tether to an inactive Tron account, don't worry. Your funds are safe. Just transfer at least 0.1 TRX to that account. Once the TRX is received, your token balance will then be visible in Ledger Live.

{"query": "I am curious if it is possible to store two recovery phrases on a single Ledger wallet.", "relevant_passages": ["private key and seed phrase whats the difference: Of course not. Its time to talk about your recovery phrase, its purpose – and how to keep it safe. Recovery Phrase: Your Crypto Fingerprint The recovery phrase – sometimes called the seed phrase or mnemonic phrase – is a 12, 18, or 24-word pattern generated each time a new wallet is created. Unlike your private key, which relates to just one blockchain address, the recovery phrase is a derivative of your entire wallet, and all private keys stored there. In laymans terms, a recover phrase is the master key for all of your crypto accounts – it is your private keys in mnemonic form. These words, when entered into another crypto wallet (in the correct order) will recover all of the private keys you were storing on your original wallet. The purpose? Giving you control. Having this phrase means that even if you lose your physical hardware device, youll still have access to your blockchain assets. BIP-39 Standard – Making Crypto Wallets Interoperable It may seem like a string of random words, but in fact the format of your recovery phrase is exactly what enables you to stay in control of your crypto. Any time a crypto wallet generates a recovery phrase, the words are selected from a list of 2048 possibilities, referred to as the BIP-39 standard Word List – more or less all wallets, including the Ledger Nano, generate recovery phrases using words from this list. By doing so, we ensure that you, the user, can access your crypto accounts from any other wallet – sort of like having a charger that fits any phone. Imagine if every wallet required a recovery phrase in a different format – your access to your crypto would be dependent on whichever type of recovery phrase you were using, meaning you dont really control your crypto at all. So by using the BIP-39 standard for generating your recovery phrase, Ledger (and all other wallets using the same standard) makes sure that you own your crypto assets, not your wallet provider. Recovery Phrase Vulnerabilities So your recovery phrase is sort of a shorthand for all of your private keys which gives you absolute control over all of your assets, even without your wallet – but it also entails some major vulnerabilities, and these need to be factored into the way you manage it. Gives Access to Multiple Crypto Accounts Unlike a private key, which corresponds to just one crypto account, the recovery phrase gives instant access to every currency in your wallet. So if it falls into the wrong hands, the potential risk to your crypto is far greater. Managed by You – Useful to Anyone And more importantly, unlike a private key, which is always concealed inside your wallet, the recovery phrase needs to be physically written down and managed by you. How you do this will define your security, because it can be used by anyone, on any other wallet – so if someone else gets hold of this phrase, consider your assets gone. So lets take a look at the best ways of storing your recovery phrase, to make sure your private keys stay absolutely safe when youre using your wallet. Storing your Recovery Phrase Safely The whole objective of using a hardware wallet is to keep your private keys away from threats, including both online and offline vectors. So it is essential that you treat your recovery phrase with the same care. Keep it Offline Storing your recovery phrase on a connected device completely defeats the purpose of using a hardware wallet: just like a private key, a hack or malware deployed via your connection could simply target your phrase, and access your whole wallet. Stay Fire and Water Proof In crypto, there is no customer service, no support team and no online database of your details. Theres just you and your recovery sheet. Learn more at: https://www.ledger.com/academy/private-key-and-seed-phrase-whats-the-difference", "How Ledger device generates 24-word recovery phrase:  How Ledger device generates 24-word recovery phrase The recovery phrase is the key to managing your crypto assets. As such, the recovery phrase should be something that is long and nearly impossible for anyone to guess. Your recovery phrase isnt like a password or a PIN (Ledger devices already have PINs to protect access to them), instead, its the root of all of your cryptographic secrets. Once your device randomly generates it for the first time and you write it down on paper, you will only need to access it if you have to recover your device. Ledger uses a standard called BIP 39 for the generation and interpretation of the recovery phrase on all of our devices. BIP 39 is an industry-standard used by many other hierarchical deterministic wallets. The exact type of BIP 39 seed used by Ledger devices by default is a 24-word mnemonic that consists of only the 2048 words from the BIP 39 English wordlist. Heres how a BIP 39 24-word mnemonic seed is generated: The device generates a sequence of 256 random bits using the True Random Number Generator (TRNG) built into the devices Secure Element. The first 8 bits of the SHA-256 hash of the initial 256 bits are appended to the end, giving us 264 bits All 264 bits are split into 24 groups of 11 bits Each group of 11 bits is interpreted as a number in the range 0 - 2047, which serves as an index to the BIP 39 wordlist, giving us 24 words. It's important to note that although a Ledger device can be restored using a recovery phrase of 12, 18, or 24 words, Ledger devices only generate 24-word recovery phrases. They do not create phrases of 12 or 18 words. The result of this process is that your device will generate a single mnemonic seed out of 2256 possible mnemonic seeds (Thats one of 115 792 089 237 316 195 423 570 985 008 687 907 853 269 984 665 640 564 039 457 584 007 913 129 639 936 possible mnemonic seeds). Note that while the first 23 words are completely random, the final word is derived from 3 random bits and 8 calculated bits from the SHA-256 hash.

{"query": "I mistakenly sent my Binance Coin (BNB) to the wrong address on my Ledger device. As a result, my transferred balance is not reflecting correctly.", "relevant_passages": ["I accidentally sent crypto to a wrong address - what now?:  I accidentally sent crypto to a wrong address - what now? This article discusses what to do if you've accidentally sent crypto to the wrong address. We can distinguish a few different scenarios for having sent crypto to the wrong address. You can read more about each situation - and if applicable solutions - below: I have sent crypto to an Ethereum-based address (starts with '0x') and haven't received it The most likely scenario is that you'd have sent your cryptocurrencies via a different network than the one you intended to receive it on. For example, if you want to send ETH to your Ethereum account, you'd need to use the Ethereum network. If instead, you used the Binance Smart Chain network, the ETH would not show up under your Ethereum account. So long as the cryptocurrency was sent from an EVM-based blockchain to a different EVM-based network, you should be able to retrieve it. If the network is supported within Ledger Live, you'd simply need to add an account for that particular blockchain. In the example mentioned above, you'd have to add a Binance Smart Chain (BNB) account and the ETH would immediately be visible there. Do keep in mind that some blockchains (e.g. BSC, MATIC, Cronos) may use a different native currency and you'd need to have some to pay for transaction fees. You can read more about recovering assets sent to a wrong network here. If the crypto asset is sent to a network that is not EVM-based, there is unfortunately the chance that your crypto may be lost.

By Ledger Jul 27, 2023 | Updated Aug 4, 2023 Read 7 min Beginner SHARE KEY TAKEAWAYS: — BRC-20 is an experimental standard for fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. — The Taproot and Ordinals protocol made the BRC-20 standard possible. — BRC-20 tokens unlock new capabilities for the Bitcoin network, such as their use in DeFi protocols and blockchain applications. Bitcoin is the first and most popular Blockchain in existence. The primary purpose of the Bitcoin network has always been a decentralized, peer-to-peer money transfer system at its core, However, it’s also often compared to digital gold, offering crypto users a secure store of value. In short, it offered consumers a way to be their own banks. Sticking true to its purpose, most Bitcoin users were happy with its security and didn’t want to use Bitcoin for much else than those core values. Meanwhile, other blockchains evolved, adding more use cases than just transferring value. For example, tokenization on other networks led to innovations like DeFi and NFTs. With Bitcoin being this popular, some users were pushing for more capabilities on BTC. And who blames them? Why not adapt and expand when possible? Well, the Taproot upgrade and the following innovation of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol created a whole new world of opportunities on Bitcoin. Now, tokens on BTC are not only possible, they have become a whole movement. Naturally, new ideas attract further innovation and one such innovation is the BRC-20 token standard. To explain, the BRC-20 standard is an experiment, primarily about exploring the possibilities Bitcoin could offer apart from its classic field of application. In other words, you can now issue tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. But before we go into the specifics, let’s unpack the basics: What are BRC-20 tokens exactly? Let’s dive in and find out. What Are BRC-20 Tokens? BRC-20 tokens are the first, yet experimental, standard for fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. If that sounds confusing—fear not!

The Transaction’s Status An often overlooked, yet very important part of a transaction: its status. For a transaction to be completed and considered valid, it first needs to be confirmed by those validating them. An unconfirmed transaction like the one shown above can still be ruled invalid or cancelled. It’s best to consider unconfirmed transactions as “not received yet” and wait till it’s actually confirmed. It is possible to see more than one sending or receiving address as well.

{"query": "Can I store bitcoin runes tokens in my Ledger", "relevant_passages": ["Connect your Ledger device to Leather Wallet to manage Bitcoin runes and ordinals: Viewing and managing Bitcoin runes, ordinals, inscriptions and BRC20 tokens is not supported in Ledger Live for the moment. What are Bitcoin Runes? Runes are fungible tokens created using the Rune protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain, developed by Casey Rodarmor, who is also known for the ordinals standard. This protocol utilizes Bitcoin's UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) for issuing and managing these tokens, and does not form a separate network or Layer 2 solution. Instead, it provides a streamlined alternative to other token systems on Bitcoin, aiming to reduce the creation of 'junk' UTXOs and associated costs. Runes can be minted and transacted directly through Bitcoin transactions following an initial 'etching' process that establishes the token's characteristics on the Bitcoin blockchain. Although runes are not supported in Ledger Live yet, they can be managed and traded by connecting your Ledger device to Xverse Wallet. Read on to learn more.

This article outlines the steps to transfer crypto from your Ledger device to your bank account, assisting you in cashing out your crypto funds. Connecting Your Bank Account to Ledger Before you can transfer funds from Ledger to your bank account, you'll need to establish a connection between the two. While Ledger Live primarily functions as a means to manage your crypto, some third-party services and applications facilitate the conversion of crypto to fiat currency and subsequent transfer to your bank. Discover Apps for Fiat Withdrawals Depending on your region, you may have access to Discover apps like Ramp, Transak, Bitply, and BTC Direct, which offer fiat withdrawal services. These platforms allow you to sell your cryptocurrencies and withdraw the resulting fiat currency directly to your bank account. By utilizing these services, you can seamlessly convert your crypto holdings into traditional currency. To learn more about these apps, navigate to the Discover section in Ledger Live, and switch the categories to Sell. Transferring Crypto to Exchanges for Fiat Withdrawals with Ledger You can transfer your crypto to a supported exchange platform that offers fiat withdrawal options, such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and others. These exchanges allow users to sell their crypto assets and withdraw the proceeds to their linked bank accounts. You can also use services like Coinify to aid in the cash-out process. However, it's important to note that most exchanges and withdrawal services require users to complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process before enabling fiat withdrawals.
